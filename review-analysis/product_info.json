Alt Mode video comes directly from the graphics card or integrated graphics processor on a device, meaning outputs from an Alt Mode video port have the full graphics acceleration of your system. Not all systems with USB-C support this functionality.\n        \n\n            HDMI 1 (Alt Mode) allows for a maximum output resolution of 4K 30Hz (3840x2160 @ 30Hz). Lower resolutions such as 1920x1200, and 1920x1080 (1080p) are supported at 60Hz. The HDMI 1.4 connection on this dock is provided by converting DisplayPort Alt Mode to HDMI 1.4.\n        \n\n            HDMI 2 and 3 (DisplayLink) allows for a maximum output resolution of 2K 60Hz (1920x1200 @ 60Hz). The HDMI 1.3 connection on this dock is provided by the DisplayLink DL-3900 USB graphics chipset.\n        \n\n            DisplayLink is a technology that allows compressed data of various types to be sent over USB data connections. The DisplayLink DL-3900 chipset in this docking station connects all the data and video connections, other than the \"4K\" HDMI 1.4 connection, on this dock.\n        \n\n            There are a few important limitations of DisplayLink technology. DisplayLink uses a proprietary compressed video stream that is partially generated by both your computer's CPU and GPU, and is a \"virtual\" video adapter. Because the video is compressed and packetized as data, then reassembled by the DisplayLink chip, the pacing of new frames of video can be inconsistent, particularly if large portions of the content being sent through DisplayLink is changing (such as with video playback).\n        \n\n            Because of how DisplayLink provides video, video outputs provided by DisplayLink technology should only be used to display content like office applications and web browser windows, not games or video content.\n        \n\n            HDCP is not supported, this means protected content such as Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube Premium, Hulu, Blu-ray videos, and other protected content, either may not work or will play at a lower resolution, depending on the content provider.\n        \n\n            Some USB-C ports Windows Laptop computers are labelled as Thunderbolt 3 ports. Thunderbolt 3 ports are USB-C ports with additional functionality that are also compatible with this docking station.\n        \n\n            USB-C Power Delivery (USB-C PD) is a standard introduced with USB-C that provides enough power for many mobile devices and laptops. This dock is able to supply up to 60W of power to a host. Some laptops may require more power than this. The Dell XPS 15 9550/9560 and Precision 5510/7510, for example, will display a warning during boot if connected to a 60W power adapter, rather than a Dell 130W power adapter.

The DisplayLink driver software for DockingStation communication is installed on your computer.\n\n\nCompatibility with host computers?\n\n\nAll your USB devices from USB 3.0 are completely supported. With an adapter, the DockingStation can additionally connected to a USB 3.0 Type-C port. Make sure that the latest USB drivers and DisplayLink drivers are installed.\n\n\nHow many monitors can I connect?\n\n\nUp to 6 monitors are possible under Windows with DisplayLink technology. Under macOS 4 monitors are possible.\n\n\nIs the DockingStation ready for gaming?\n\n\nNo, first and foremost this technology is designed for productive use.\n\n\nIs Windows 10 supported?\n\n\nYes, please install the newest Windows DisplayLink Driver to you Windows device.\n\n\nCan I use the DockingStation with Mac?\n\n\nYes, please install the newest macOS DisplayLink Driver to you Apple device.ATTENTION: Apple devices with the operating system macOS 10.13.4 are not supported! As of macOS 10.13.5 and higher, the operation of the DockingStation is again possible without limitations!\n\n\nIs the notebook charged through the DockingStation?\n\n\nNo, this is not possible with DisplayLink technology. The notebook must be powered separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow easy is the setup?\n\n\nSimply install the DisplayLink driver software and connect the DockingStation to your notebook or PC. The DisplayLink driver automatically configures the monitor for optimal display quality and saves these settings for future use.\n\n\nThe included USB cable is too short, can I use a third-party cable?\n\n\nYes, this is basically possible. But is not recommended.\n\n\nDoes the DockingStation prevent the use of video connections on the notebook directly?\n\n\nNo, using the DockingStation does not limit the functionality of your notebook in any way.\n\n\nDoes the DockingStation support audio output via HDMI or DisplayPort?\n\n\nYes, this is supported if your monitor has built-in speakers. To do this, you will need to change the default audio output in your system accordingly.\n\n\nNo network connection via the DockingStation, but via the host computer. What is the problem?\n\n\nIt is possible that the LAN/WLAN is only released for a known MAC address. In this case, the MAC address of the DockingStation and notebooks must be equated, or the passthrough of the MAC address of the notebook must be enabled. You can usually make this setting in the BIOS of your notebook.\n\n\nThe monitor does not turn on again after the notebook wakes from sleep mode. What to do ?\n\n\nOn your monitor, change the input signal setting from AUTO to the specific source you are using (e.g., HDMI or DisplayPort). If the automatic search for an active connection does not find a video signal after a long time, the monitor goes into sleep mode and may stop responding to any signal from the DockingStation. Windows may have automatically turned off the USB root hub to save power. To prevent this from happening, follow these simple steps to change the USB root hub settings in order to stay active during sleep mode.", "rating": "4.5"}, "": {}}, "U3HDMIDVIDOCKUS": {"https://www.amazon.com/Wavlink-Universal-Docking-Ethernet-Ultrabook/dp/B019XOJ874/ref=sr_1_29?dchild=1&keywords=universal+docking+station+2x+hdmi+2x+displayport+power+delivery&qid=1621988191&s=electronics&sr=1-29": {"title": "WAVLINK USB 3.0 and USB C Universal Laptop Docking Station Dual Monitor with HDMI & DVI/VGA with Gigabit Ethernet, 6 USB Ports, Audio for Laptop, Ultrabook and PCs, More Efficient Home Office", "price": "$79.99", "bullets": ["\nBuilt-in HDMI and DVI outputs each resolution up to 1920x1200 @ 60Hz, HDMI port supports resolutions up to 2560x1440@ 50Hz with a single HDMI display only.
