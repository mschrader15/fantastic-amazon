       "    \"works as advertised on a Surface Laptop 3. i can extend my desktop to 2 additional 2560x1440@60Hz monitors. it uses displayport MST/Alternate mode magic. so it requires no drivers or Displaylink nonsense. great for productivity. image quality is fine, but this will largely depend on laptop graphics capabilities. it's very portable. while plastic, it feels reasonably nice & well-built.unfortunately the extender has numerous quirks that make it a little obnoxious to use.the extender behaves erratically when the laptop sleeps. when waking the laptop, most times the extender won't wake the monitors normally. one or both monitors will just stay dark or even completely disconnect. it's so unreliable that there's just no point putting the laptop to sleep with it connected, as only disconnecting & reconnecting will fix it. multiple connect/disconnect cycles per day has me concerned for the longevity of the usb connector & port. reconnects don't always remember monitor positions. on occasion, i'll need to go back into display properties & rearrange the monitor layouts. reconnects also never remember window positions. each time all my active windows are restored to scrambled locations, or all moved to one screen. these quirks could be the fault of the display driver, but it becomes a chore during daily use of this extender.good enough for what its intended to do. but i might look for another displayport MST hub or dock with fewer quirks & return this.\",\n",
       "    \"I connected three monitors, but it doesn't show on all 3 monitors. To make sure the connections are good, I disconnected one, then it works perfect with the other two. I tried this for each one, and whenever only 2 monitors are connected, no matter which two, it works. But when all three are connected, it shows one can not work as a small icon.\",\n",
       "    'This has issues on my Dell Inspiron 13-7378 USB C (dp) connection.  I have three 27\" Samsung monitors.  One is connected to the HDMI port on the Dell.  The other two are HDMI connected to this splitter.  The computer will run 4 monitors, however I had to set each external monitor at 59hz before the two connected to this device would work.  I found the 59hz solution by accident, not by advice from Startech.  Before this, the monitors connected to this devices would work for about an hour, then start blacking out (off and then on) about every 90 seconds.  Not sure what is wrong, however it is very annoying.  This didn\\'t happen when I removed the Startech splitter, and only use the one natively attached HDMI monitor and the laptop display.  Startech technical support replaced the device at their cost as the original didn\\'t work, however that was before I set the monitors to 59hz. Since it\\'s been replaced, and the monitors set to 59hz, the monitors don\\'t do the flashing thing, however  randomly, the intel graphics HD reconfigures the DP topology.',\n",
       "    \"I got this to be able to switch from plugging in/unplugging 3 monitors to just plugging in one thing when I set my laptop down at work.  So, it does that job admirably.  It even fixed the problem I would have where windows would just disappear into the ether after locking Windows 10 and signing back in, so the display adapter drivers are exceptional.However, I'm currently having an issue where one of the monitors won't wake up when it starts receiving signal, so I have to turn it off and turn it back on every time I log into my computer in order to see what's on that screen.  I think it has to do with the hub, since I didn't have this problem before, but I haven't looked into it enough to say for certain.  Just know, it's possible it won't be as plug-and-play as most users would hope.\",\n",

The other odd problem is an intermittent event (plus system sound) that originates in the Intel OED sound driver, possibly trying to access (non-existent) audio in the monitors.I'm overdue some driver/firmware updates which might fix these.

I am using this on both my MAC and X1 laptop. i will buy another product from this company.\",\n",
       "    \"works as advertised on a Surface Laptop 3. i can extend my desktop to 2 additional 2560x1440@60Hz monitors. it uses displayport MST/Alternate mode magic. so it requires no drivers or Displaylink nonsense. great for productivity. image quality is fine, but this will largely depend on laptop graphics capabilities. it's very portable. while plastic, it feels reasonably nice & well-built.unfortunately the extender has numerous quirks that make it a little obnoxious to use.the extender behaves erratically when the laptop sleeps. when waking the laptop, most times the extender won't wake the monitors normally. one or both monitors will just stay dark or even completely disconnect. it's so unreliable that there's just no point putting the laptop to sleep with it connected, as only disconnecting & reconnecting will fix it. multiple connect/disconnect cycles per day has me concerned for the longevity of the usb connector & port. reconnects don't always remember monitor positions. on occasion, i'll need to go back into display properties & rearrange the monitor layouts. reconnects also never remember window positions. each time all my active windows are restored to scrambled locations, or all moved to one screen. these quirks could be the fault of the display driver, but it becomes a chore during daily use of this extender.good enough for what its intended to do. but i might look for another displayport MST hub or dock with fewer quirks & return this.\",\n",
       "    \"I connected three monitors, but it doesn't show on all 3 monitors. To make sure the connections are good, I disconnected one, then it works perfect with the other two.

       "    'This has issues on my Dell Inspiron 13-7378 USB C (dp) connection.  I have three 27\" Samsung monitors.  One is connected to the HDMI port on the Dell.  The other two are HDMI connected to this splitter.  The computer will run 4 monitors, however I had to set each external monitor at 59hz before the two connected to this device would work.  I found the 59hz solution by accident, not by advice from Startech.  Before this, the monitors connected to this devices would work for about an hour, then start blacking out (off and then on) about every 90 seconds.  Not sure what is wrong, however it is very annoying.  This didn\\'t happen when I removed the Startech splitter, and only use the one natively attached HDMI monitor and the laptop display.  Startech technical support replaced the device at their cost as the original didn\\'t work, however that was before I set the monitors to 59hz. Since it\\'s been replaced, and the monitors set to 59hz, the monitors don\\'t do the flashing thing, however  randomly, the intel graphics HD reconfigures the DP topology.',\n",

It even fixed the problem I would have where windows would just disappear into the ether after locking Windows 10 and signing back in, so the display adapter drivers are exceptional.However, I'm currently having an issue where one of the monitors won't wake up when it starts receiving signal, so I have to turn it off and turn it back on every time I log into my computer in order to see what's on that screen.  I think it has to do with the hub, since I didn't have this problem before, but I haven't looked into it enough to say for certain.  Just know, it's possible it won't be as plug-and-play as most users would hope.\",\n",

For that I used a Diamond Multimedia Wireless HDMI USB Powered Extender Kit, TV Transmitter & Receiver for HD 1080p.  I bought this product that I am currently reviewing, the Anker USB C to Dual HDMI Adapter, Compact and Portable USB C Adapter, hoping to at least mirror one of the office screens to the bedroom flat screen TV, but what I got was the best possible setup, THREE independent external monitors, plus the laptop screen for a total of FOUR monitors.

       "    \"Arrived quickly, well worth the price as apposed to cheap single hdmi switches from less reputable manufacturers with mix reviews.Also Not sure if my eyes are playing tricks on me but colours on display seemed more vivid on my plasma when using this apposed to the laptops onboard hdmi port that I've been using for pat 2 years.£30 for 2 hdmi ports is a decent price. Size is as described, so very portable, might of been better with a removable cable but size of connected cable seems just right for it's purpose and usage.£45 for the version with 85w power delivery and other ports. Also a good price if you need those extra ports.Worked out of the box with both my TV and Monitor using HDMI. Allowing My Windows 10 laptop to have 3 extended monitors including its own.Was able to easily swap between monitor display modes (duplicate/extend/disable) and positioning for each independently using the windows 10 display settings.Display options where remembered and was able to easily unplug usb to return to default laptop screen and when I plugged USB-C back in it would activate previous monitor configuration (as long as same monitors are connector to hdmi ports, doesn't matter if ports are swapped)Tested and Achieved 1080p 60hz for both my monitor and TV on SDR.Can't speak to 4k refresh rates or HDR as I don't have a 4k display, HDR or higher refresh rate monitor, TV to test on.Also not sure on my laptop's exact DP version as manufacturer only states DP and charge but as it's not Thunderbolt 3 I'm assuming most likely 1.2 and 1.4 if I'm lucky. Will be able to tell with 4k monii depending on refresh rates if description is to be accurate.Unit housing does get warm when in use, nothing that seems dangerous though. (This was on a hot summers day, so higher ambient temperature than normal)I would recommend personally as it not only allows 2 external monitors through one port it also makes it easy to switch through monitors with out having to constantly swap cables or use hdmi switchers.TLDR: worth the £30 I paid. £45 version would be better option if you need power delivery (85w if provided 100w) and extra ports.\",\n",

One thing I noticed is that you need to have the proper cables (the PC hooked into DP), so I ordered HDMI 2.0 certified cables (a must for 4k) from monoprice.  I was careful not to hook any other cables into the T3 bus on that side and put the port extender for USB/etc on the other bus.It worked right away, however no matter what I tried I could only achieve 4K/30Hz.  Since I am not gaming (this is a work laptop) it is not that bad, but you can certainly see the lag in Mac animations.  The view was no better or worse than my VDI connection.  I referenced the Mac (it says it supports dual 60Hz, the LG (it definately works and supports this according to the manual) -- the DP port works at 60Hz, and this product says it works at 60Hz dual.I am suspect of any of these products working at 60Hz, be wary to run dual 4K monitors @60Hz with a 2017 MBP.I picked up a cheap Omotion stand for clamshell mode and I am off to the races.  No docking station needed, so from there a winner.I also think the price is high because there are many offbrands which offer 4k dual at 30Hz for 1/3 the price, so value-wise it does not make it.',\n",

In addition, I couldn't connect to the internet (and I double checked that other devices in the house had internet connectivity).So I took the HDMI-USB-C cable I had been using with my single-monitor set up, and reconnected it.

       "    \"I needed a HDMI to Thunderbolt 3 adapter for my MacBook Pro and I grabbed this based on glowing reviews and the fact that I've had great prior experiences with Sabrent's SSD drives. Well, this adapter was a bust. It started working for about three hours, then there was screen flickering on one of the two screens and it going black at random intervals. I ended up unplugging it throughout the workday, which was maddening after a while. Whenever I did unplug it, I noticed that it was extremely hot to the touch (never a good sign). First, I thought that maybe I had a bad cord, so I bought a pair of new HDMI cords. Nope, still had the same issues. Then I decided to exchange the adapter for another one as it was totally possible I just was unlucky and got a defective one. Nope, still the same issues. The only time the adapter didn't end up flickering was when only one screen was plugged in, which effectively made it useless.Now it could totally be that my two 4K screens could just be too powerful for this little adapter. Perhaps this dongle is using old technology that can only handle one 4K screen at a time. However, if that's the case, they need to relabel their product to state that it can only handle two 2K screens or one 4K screen. Anyway, for those MacBook owners looking for a way to bump up their screen real estate to two 4K monitors, I recommend putting some more money down on a more expensive dock rather than a cheaper adapter like this one.

Not only is it much easier to connect, since it's the same upside down, but it does so much more.Unfortunately, I don't have a single device with more than a single USB C port, so I do appreciate that I can use this adaptor like an HDMI splitter, and get dual screens with a high resolution from my laptop, and one duplicated screen from my Note 8 cellphone.  I don't have a video output that's high enough for this product.  It will be up to date for years.  Two 4K screens?  That's awesome.It's pretty simple to use.  Just plug and play.  USB C seems to supply enough power.  The device was warm after using it for three hours, but not hot, and it never stopped working.One thing I do is give Powerpoint presentations.  A common issue is technical stuff keeping the presentations off a screen, even though where I work is full of podiums with HDMI ports.  I keep this in my bag, connect my cell phone to the screen, and my powerpoint is running just as if it were on a computer.  It really makes me seem resourceful and prepared, and I have peace of mind that no matter what problems pop up, I will have a smooth presentation.Like my Sabrent USB hubs, this is a simple product, with normal plastic construction, but it's sturdy.  I've used those Sabrent hubs for years without any issue, while other hubs have failed.  The cables are attached nicely and should be able to take a little abuse over the years.It's a great product.\",\n",

I have two Windows 10 systems with Thunderbolt 3 ports (not just USB-C), and neither will output anything to displays connected to this device. Windows recognizes the unit, but nothing further.With no drivers clearly available on Sabrent\\'s website, it makes me wonder if this device was rushed to market, with drivers soon to follow. Personally, I find that \"Some Windows Systems\" is enough to steer me away from similarly marked items in the future. YMMV.But that\\'s JustMe.',\n",
       "    \"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I got this Sabrent Thuderbolt3 Dual HDMI adapter because I am using a 2018 Macbook Pro and with my MacBook I only have 4 USB- C ports and that’s it. I do a lot of video editing and graphics and I needed something that would give me the ability to have extra monitors with 4K. I’ve been using this for a while and here are the things that I think are important.Pros:1. THIS ADAPTER DID NOT get hot at all while I was using it and it works great!2. The cable on this Sabrent adapter is longer than most adapter cables which is a big plus.3. If you are only using one monitor, you can use either HDMI port 1 or 2, it doesn’t matter.4. If you want 4K, this truly puts out in 4K and @ 60Hz which was awesome! The blue light indicator lights up and lets you know that the adapter is 4K ready.5. It has the rubber strips on the bottom so you don’t have to worry about scratching your desk and its really light making it easy to just unplug and carry with you.6. This adapter will let you “mirror” or “extend” one or both of your monitor(s). This was the winning touch because I’ve tried other adapters and couldn’t separate the function.Not So Pro:1. The price is a bit high at $89 compared to other adapters out there, but this adapter is true quality and all the reviews will tell you the same.2. This is for ThunderBolt3 devices so if your laptop or PC isn’t ThunderBolt3 compatible this may not work, so make sure.3. It wasn’t a big deal, but every night I put my Macbook in sleep mode before I go to bed and there were maybe 2 times that I had to simply restart my Macbook for the other monitor(s) to be recognized. Don’t know why it happened but it worked like a charm after restart.OVERALL:This is a must have and I would highly recommend this adapter before you go out and buy a bunch of other dongles and/or take “chances” on other ones. This adapter does exactly what it says and I use it daily for multiple hours. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because I wish it had a USB-C charging port on it so I could plug my Macbook's charging cable directly into it. Outside of that, it's a definite 5 star.\",\n",
       "    'This device works great for those type c devices. It works great for the macbook, windows, or even chrome. Be aware that a device can connect to a 4k display using this but the device does not enhance the video output. What I mean is that if the device does not support 4k output the screen will need to be adjusted to the resolution that the device can support. The device is a bit on the large side so if you have a small desk just be aware it will take up a small amount of space. Another thing I would say is the device does get warm when it in heavy use. It does not come with an HDMI cables just the device and it does not require additional power to be used. It also does not work for phones but it can work for tablets. It worked pretty well for my google slate which is nice. It does come with a good length of wire but I would not have it hanging off the side of the desk as you can possibly fray the wire overtime. Overall I think this is a great product to have if you want to have dual screens on 4k monitors/tv. It does the job without any issue to video or pictures just be aware that the device you are plugging this into need to support 4k output to output at 4k level.',\n",
       "    'This is a review for the Sabrent Thunderbolt 3 to Dual HDMI 2.0 AdapterI really like this and recommend it. Here’s why.A big plus is the easy setup: Plug-n-Play; no software or drivers needed.It’s features are great as well. There’s not just a USB3 to 4K adapter but a USB3 to dual 4K adapter. The adapter device is not too large-2/3, the size of a 2.5” external flash drive. It has a soft blue light to tell you it’s getting power. The USB3 cable is thick so I feel it’s not going to be easily broken or crimped. The USB3 cable is not too long nor too short; it’s about a foot long.It’s also hot-swappable; you can connect the Sabrent and a display to it live, no need to power down first.It’s performance also gets a big thumb’s up from me. I plugged two 4K displays into my MacBook Pro and the video and frame rate on each was perfect. I ran an animation tests and on both simultaneously and the adapter passed both displays the 4K images without any issues.If you want a good, solid well-made dual 4K adapter that only uses one Thunderbolt 3 port then this is a perfect device to add to your laptop or desktop Mac or Windows system that supports Thunderbolt 3 and Dual 4K displays.',\n",
       "    'To test this, we plugged the Sabrent into our 2018 MacBook Pro.  This is a plug & go device; no installation is required.  We connected the Mac to 2 32\" TVs, such that with the laptop and TVs, we had 3 screens going.  When you initially plug into the device, it goes straight into extended mode (3 different screens), but you can easily switch to mirror mode if you want all the screens to be the same.It does not matter which port the device is plugged in to, and it has a nice, slim plug (it won\\'t block you other ports!!).  The cable for the Sabrent is about 1.5\\' long, which is adequate without being too long.  It does not require a power adapter.  It also has nice rubber feet on the bottom to keep it fixed to your desk.It remained cool after quite a long use, so overheating doesn\\'t appear to be a problem.

I already had 1 monitor connected to my Macbook via a single HDMI to USB-C connector that I use daily at work.  Now I bought a 2nd monitor for use at work.  I could either plug in both separately, or with this dual connector so I only have to plug back in one thing each time.  Well, it works :) .It appears to me to be constructed well, looks professional for on my desk, and the connections all seems solid.  One thing to mention that I think is more to do with the macbook than the connector, as it is the same with my previous single HDMI connector from another brand, is that sometimes I have to unplug & re-plug it in the USB-C port for the macbook to recognize that display after waking it up from sleep while remaining connected at my desk.  Sometimes it is fine, and sometimes I have to reconnect.  But honestly, this is the same with any other USB-C connector I have used from any brand.  I don't think it is the connector, but the macbook detection and handling of any such thing.  You will see the same review comment from people on most such USB-C monitor connectors.\",\n",

In our setup, the person running the slides uses the built in display, then we have a second display going to our projectors and the third display going to lyrics/confidence monitors.  Therefore, we need two extra video adapters to run the latter two to our video switching/livestreaming setup (ATEM TV Studio Pro4k).  We had been using two individual USB-C to HDMI adapters (which we then had to convert to SDI), but sometimes the two external displays would swap position due to the way they were recognized.  Long story short, with this adapter, it has relieved this problem and freed up a USB-C port (also Thunderbolt 3).  We aren't running any of the outputs as 4k, so I can't comment on the resolution, but in terms of recognizing both outputs and keeping them routed to consistent positions, it has worked very well.\",\n",

       "   'content': [\"First, it doesn't support charging the laptop. I thought I would mention this first.If you are looking for USB-C however, it is wonderful.The power adapter that comes with it is very powerful, 110 Watts in fact. Enough for HDMI, USBs, SD, Audio, etc.The USB-C on the dock only does charging, no data connection.The Dual HDMI can in fact output 4K, and works well. My graphics card was able to identify it right away.I rest my laptop on the dock and set it against the wall, this allows my laptop to get some more airflow underneath, and I don't have to see all the stuff plugged in.Or you can set it right next to you, you can decide!Either way, for its price I think it's a great dock.\",\n",
       "    \"As a background, I'm a full-time student who originally bought this for ethernet and HDMI for one external monitor. I'm not doing anything super heavy. I'm using a decade old Dell monitor for my external so I can't comment on refresh rates/speeds in regards to newer, more high quality monitors.If all you need to know is if this will work on a Mac with a M1 chip, it will. This has two HDMI ports, but since I don't have two external monitors, I cannot comment on that. I know the M1 MacBook Air natively supports one external monitor. I live on a college campus so the ethernet port is a godsend.I seriously appreciate that this has USB 2.0 AND USB 3.0. I have some things on my desk that will only power on when plugged into USB 3.0 and to be able to use the dock for that is so much more convenient than my previous rig.I didn't notice this when initially purchasing, but it does come with a large power brick. One reviewer said it MUST be plugged in, but I haven't found that to be true in regards of using my external monitor or USB peripherals. I only plug this in when it's absolutely necessary to charge my Mac.My only complaint is the dock's USB-C cable, in my opinion, is a little awkward in length. I have a pretty small desk, so this isn't going to apply to most people. It's too long to be able to just sit out besides my Mac, but it's almost too short to sit comfortably behind my Mac. I wish it was either very short so it sat right next to my Mac OR so long I could just velcro it to the side of my desk using a 3M strip. I'm able to prop it behind their, but I'm worried I'm going to wear out the cable. Not taking off any stars for this as it's a problem very few people will have.All in all, I got it for a very good price. It was under $100 at the time of purchase. I think it's worth for what I paid for it.\",\n",
       "    \"I really liked this hub for my Chromebook.  It had the double monitor feature, etc. that I needed. It was all good until today when it just failed...stopped working completely.  I unplugged the power cable to determine if it was a power issue, but it wasn't.  The unit itself just quit.  It was a lot of money for something that lasted only a few months.  Won't purchase again.\",\n",
       "    'I bought this dock to become an all in one solution for my MacBook. I was tired of having to have multiple things plugged in taking up multiple ports on my computer, and searched for a product that would be able to provide me with a multitude of inputs while only utilizing one of my USB-C ports.I stumbled upon this product here and decided to go ahead with it. It certainly is not the cheapest of docks that are on this site, but I enjoyed the space grey which would match my MacBook. Also, the build quality looked great in the product photos, so I figured I would give it a shot.The device it plugged in to an external power source to be able to provide power to the computer. It is also very important to note that it will only provide 60W of power, which is capable for 13 inch MacBook pros as well as MacBook Airs. 15-16 inch MacBook Pro users such as myself will find themselves having their battery slowly drain when attempting to utilize this as a peer source, so buyer be aware of that prior. I personally just use my provided charger.Overall, the build quality is quite great, which coming in at the 99$ price point is very welcoming. The amount of ports it provides more than suits my needs. If you are trying to play audio out of it, just make sure to go to system preferences, MIDI controller, and select USB device. Took me a few minutes to realize to do this and every since it works like a charm.Simply put, I definitely am satisfied with this purchase, and had they had a 96W version, I would happily go about purchasing that!',\n",
       "    'everything \"works\" fine... my qualms is that the hdmi ports are not aligned with the housing and the port itself isn\\'t an exact fit for an hdmi cable and can sometimes go in crooked and doesn\\'t connect the screen.Also, these hdmi ports dont support more than 75hz|60hz when using both. Both sides cannot be set to 75hz equally nor do they go higher. It will only allow me to use 144hz in single mode. I\\'m using this with two 24\" 144hz 1080p monitors.-- UPDATE --I also noticed the PD pass through power doesn\\'t supply enough power for my Samsung 13\" NP930 laptop and gives a warning that I attached a slow charger.Given these issues I am upgrading to 4 stars because the seller offered me a full refund/replacement, but I opted for a partial refund as I intend to keep this as it does get the job done. I don\\'t believe a replacement will \"fix\" these issues.',\n",
       "    \"I tried maybe like 5 different USBC docking stations that were cheaper and likely very similar but they all suffered from not being able to drive multiple high resolution monitors. Most dual HDMI docking stations can handle one 2K monitor just fine, but if you plug 2 in you are limited to HD resolution. This is the only one that worked with dual 2K output at 60hz no issues that I tried.Few other things I like about this dock:1. Comes with a dedicated power supply. The cheaper ones required a dedicated USBC based PD supply, which adds to the cost of the setup. It's a power brick barrel style power supply which is actually better for my setup as I don't need my dock to be portable. The dock works without the PSU but doesn't charge your laptop obviously.2. Has a Ethernet jack, the cheapest docks don't have them or they are buggy. Doesn't have legacy ports but in my testing these were buggy on other docks particularly the audio jacks were unusable.3. Ports are all on one side. Make cable management a bit cleaner to not have to route cables on both sides.4. Longer USBC cable. The cable that connects to your laptop is much longer than other cheap docks by a lot, probably twice as long. This gives some more flexibility on where you position your dock.5. More premium looking than other docks and was certainly packaged nicer.If you just want to drive a single 4K monitor or dual HD monitors, you can find other docks for around $40 but you will need to buy a separate USBC PD supply so even then I recommend this for not much more.The only thing worth mentioning is I originally bought a used one from warehouse deals for cheaper (around $50). There were several available used which is usually a red flag. The used one I received was unable to charge my laptop. I ended up buying a new one ($70) which has no issues, but I am concerned about future reliability. If I have issues I will update this post.\",\n",
       "    \"I keep my Macbook Pro in clamshell mode at my desk 90% of the time, so I wanted a powered USB-C docking station for my external storage array, web cam, microphone, and HDMI display. This looked like it fit the bill - but I wanted to buy it and forget it was there, and instead I find myself having to work around it. That's dissatisfying.Wake from sleep is the biggest thing. I'll tap my keyboard/mouse and the laptop will come on (I can hear the audio when I hit backspace repeatedly on the empty password prompt) but the display will take 20-30 seconds to come on, presumably from some negotiation with the HDMI over USB-C. I've not had the same problem with other adapters. Sometimes, I'll have to manually move the HDMI cable to the other HDMI port just to get it to wake up.Additionally, the pass-through power sometimes just stops working. My power cable will be in the USB-C port on the docking station, the Macbook will report that it's using wall power, but the laptop will continue to drain charge - almost as if it's using the docking station's power cable instead of my Macbook Charger. When I unplug the Macbook charger from the docking station and connect it to a different USB-C port directly on my Mac, the docking station resets - my storage array reports being disconnected without being unmounted.It's good enough most of the time - I'm not going to return it or get another one. I just don't like how often I have to remember it's there and negotiate with it. That's not how it should work.\",\n",

It's on the description, but it's obscured and I missed it when I purchased it. If you can support Mirroring you can support Extended, so I am very disappointed about that. When I detach from the dock and then reconnect it doesn't always connect and I have to shuffle the cables to get it to work.2020-10-18 - I had purchased one similar to this last year and loved it, but they were out of stock. So I went shopping around and found this device. My expectations are pretty simple, I needed dual HDMI. This device fit that bill plus it was flat so I could lay the laptop on top of that. With all the ports on the backside it makes it easy to get setup and not have to touch it again. Once it arrived, I plugged it in and connected the cords and it worked as expected.Very happy with it so far and have recommended to several colleagues.\",\n",
       "    'HP upgraded my  Spectre X360 T15 CH000 (about two years old)  to a Spectre X360 T15 EB000 due to warranty issues. I am using a Dell TB16 Thunderbolt docking station. I like the TB16\\'s.  They are readily available used at a good price, and have every imaginable port on them. It worked fine with the CH000, but the monitors would not wake up after the power-off timeout on the EB000.HP\\'s service was excellent -- they tried everything to get it to work, but to no avail.  So I told them no problem, I would be happy to buy a new docking station. Please recommend something. They had no Thunderbolt recommendations.  Ok, I run three USB 3.0 hard drives  and other stuff, but could live with USB-C.  Their recommendation for that was one of their \"Travel Docks\" with only one video port, no audio.... A pretty low-end unit.  I need two video ports.My son loaned me a Vava USB-C 8-in-1 hub to try, thinking if it worked, I could order this docking station. It worked fine.  I simply plugged it into the Thunderbolt port on the TB16, connected the monitor, leaving the drives and everything else connected to the TB16.Since I need two video ports, so I ordered this.  It plugs into the TB-16 and handles both monitors. I am not using the external power supply that came with this unit.I also tried using this as a bona fide docking station. It works fine.  No drivers to install. I was concerned that the 60-watt power rating would be insufficient to charge the laptop. HP claims that you need 130 watts.  But it charges it as rapidly as the TB16 does. I did some research and found out that 60 watts is all that you can get thru that little USB C cable anyway. (There is apparently a new standard that can handle 100 watts, but I doubt my laptop can utilize that.) The power supply included with this product is actually 96 watts out, and is more heavy-duty than the picture would suggest.The quality of construction is excellent.  The case is aluminum.Anyway, if you need a USB-C docking station or simply a hub to add video ports, USB ports, etc. you will not be disappointed with this unit.',\n",
       "    'I purchased the VAVA 12 in 1 USB type C docking station to use with a 2018 MacBook Air. I will tell you right off the bat that it is a great portable solution that provides a plethora of expansion capabilities.It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, one SD card slot, one TF card slot, gigabit ethernet, a couple of 4K HDMI ports and even an old-style headphone port, and an additional PD port (charge only).I tested the HDMI ports to mirror and extend my screen with a 42 inch Samsung LCD TV, and it looks great for presentations and documents with fantastic results. Unfortunately, I do not have another TV to test using two external monitors at the same time.All of the other ports were fully functional, and I was able to see USB thumb drives and external drives with no issues and very fast speeds on the USB 3.0 ports. I used the USB 2.0 port for a wired mouse, and it was fine.My one minor gripe is that the power supply is a little bigger than the docking station and makes the entire package a tiny bit less portable. But as an added and unexpected benefit, I found out that even without the AC adapters, you can use the VAVA as a standard USB hub!So to wrap this review up, I can tell you that the VAVA USB C docking station provides a ton of connectivity, powerful charging for an iPad or iPhone and is a great value. I am very happy with mine.',\n",

After hunting around, this was what I picked.While waiting for my order to arrive I watched a video that compared many units, one was a Vava. They hated it, but it was a smaller unit they tested. When it arrived I hooked it up and have been very pleased with it. I have had no issues with it for the last month or so. It does get a bit warm on one side near the power input and CDMI  output, but would not call it hot. I have had no shutdowns. I have a few USB items connected to it and occasionally insert a micro SD or memory stick into it, and have been pleased with the transfer speeds, much better than my old setup!All in all it is doing exactly what I needed and giving me no issues.

I had to turn the external monitor on and off also, so if you have a thunderbolt 4 connector, then you should be fine - provided that you update the drivers/firmware and you cycle your external monitor on and off.The Yoga also charges because the VAVA provides 65W of power output - overall, I am, again, very satisfied with the product. I did write a message to customer support to which they answered that the Yoga 9i's thunderbolt port did not have DP protocol, which is, of course, incorrect. Despite their suggestion to give up, I went ahead and updated all the drivers and firmware that I could and it works now.**** the review below is no longer relevant ***I have tested the HDMI cable (plugged it directly into my laptop with a USB-C converter).

That said, this device seems to overheat on the regular.  I\\'ve only had it 3 days now and I\\'ve had it fully stop four times already.  When this happens, *something* in the dock wigs out.  The monitor signal start to get drift/abberations.  The charger just stops charging.  The gig-e port full on dies.  The fix is to just let it sit for a bit, it cools down, and then it works again.  I can feel it getting physically warm to the touch even at idle, but when I\\'m doing a large data transfer and the GPU/CPU on my machine are running hard, it seems like it just doesn\\'t have enough juice to support it all.  The manual says it provides 96W of power to the dock, but the Amazon description says 65W.  Maybe it just isn\\'t meant to handle the sort of load a 16\" MBP can put out even though all the marketing clearly shows it working with a Mac?Update: Because the manual said this would work on a Mac and it *mostly* worked on my system, I lent it to a friend with a 2020 MacBook Air.  It has been working perfectly for that system.  My guess is that it just can\\'t handle the extra power draw of the bigger system, but she\\'s had excellent luck with it.

On Windows 10, everything worked out of the box without any tinkering and my laptop has two additional screens for a triple display which has become essential doing healthcare from home. It also makes it very easy to switch between my work assigned laptop and my personal computer if I want to use my space for gaming or something else.I do wish the cord was a little bit longer, as shown in the photo, while I know it's designed to sit under the laptop the placement of my USBC port does not allow that so it sits at this funny angle. I'm still able to stash it under my monitor stand so it's not a big deal.I was hesitant to order a dock which required its own power supply, in part because almost all my outlets are in use and also the power supply is huge, but once everything is set up I forget it's there and ultimately it does what I need it to.The dock I was using previously was a $30 one, but you really do get what you pay for.\",\n",

They kindly sent me a new item to test it out. My honest review is that I think the first item had a defective battery. The keyboard and the mouse would suddenly glitch for several seconds. However, I have experienced only a few case of glitching with the new item. Looking for a bluetooth mouse without the usb connector (it's cheaper than I thought) would be an option as well.

Adding a USB network adapter onto this same unit works fine. Go figure, but that's another spend to make this useful. Nope.Also why are all the ports on one side?

       "    \"My wife began teaching remotely and we wanted her to have a computer setup where a laptop is usually connected to two monitors and other devices at home, but could still easily be disconnected and taken with her when needed.  We bought a high end HP laptop that has a full Thunderbolt USB C port and set about finding a dock that would do what we needed.  The minimum requirement was to drive two 60Hz HD displays (1080p resolution) and the stretch goal was to connect the laptop to everything through a single cable to the dock.  That included input power to the laptop, video out to both displays and USB connections to a webcam and desktop microphone.I first tried using with the $250 Dell dock that I had at work.  I knew from experience that working with that dock can require updating its firmware or the driver on your computer to make it work.  However, no matter what I tried with that dock, it had several consistent problems when connected to the HP laptop.  When the computer woke from sleep, it often failed to wake one or both monitors and reestablish the connections to the webcam and microphone.  I gave up on that dock and, based on reviews here, decided to try the much less expensive Vava USB C docking station.To my astonishment, after connecting everything up and powering the dock, it all just worked right away.  No drivers to install, no fussing around with connections that only work sometimes, nothing.  And it hasn't given us any trouble in the months we've had it.  I can't speak for its ability to work with a non-Thunderbird USB C port or a 4K display.  Nor have we used its ethernet connection, card reader or audio output features.  But all the other (more critical) stuff works great.  I'm very satisfied and highly recommend this dock!\",\n",

Eventually the same became true for all the other ports, never working unless I first plugged in the device and then boot up my computer. Today, after just short of six months of ownership, the Vava dock has completed its transformation into a brick. Not a single port works for anything no matter what I do. I am back to having six different cords plugged into my laptop, and my wallet is $100 lighter.***EditSince writing this review, I have been contacted by the customer service team and they have opened a dialog with me in the hopes of regaining my trust in their brand. The apologies, respect, and understanding offered by an exceptional customer service team have made the whole experience much better.',\n",

The ability to charge my laptop and have it connected to my monitors and usb devices/charging at the same time is amazing.Additionally I love how minimalistic the design is, it's very low profile! If you use a couple command strips to attach it to the underside of your desk you can keep most of the wires out of sight and free your desk space.One thing to note for any gamers out there is that the HDMI ports only support up to 60Hz refresh rate, however for everyone else this would be totally fine.Great for at home office!\",\n",
       "    \"This docking station is really slim and portable to carry around, and I really like how it is so light and stylish. This is my first time using the USB-C cable docking station, and so far, the experience seems to be pretty good. It was effortless to connect the docking to my laptop to use it straight out of the box. It came with two HDMI ports, which is really great as I need two monitors to do most of my work from home.  The power supply can charge my laptop, although I would have preferred its size to be a little smaller for travel purposes. There are four total USB ports, two of them have the 3.0 functionality for faster data transfer speeds, and there are also two memory card ports to connect the SD cards directly into the docking station. Overall, the docking station's design and build quality are great, and I am really pleased with the purchase.\",\n",
       "    \"I tried this product with a new (manufactured 4/2020) Dell Latitude 7400 with Windows 10 2004, BIOS and all drivers up to date per Dell/Intel/Microsoft.  It correctly operated my connected devices (one 2K HDMI monitor, webcam, external powered speakers through 3.5mm jack, and an extra USB hub for low-bandwidth wireless keyboard and mouse receivers).  It also powered the laptop when the external A/C adapter brick was connected to the dock.However, when I powered the laptop through the dock, I found that any CPU activity, including moving a window around the screen or opening a browser or mail client, causes a high-pitched static noise, similar to crumpling a piece of paper. The noise is coming from the laptop itself, not the external speakers, and it's not the fan. The noise occurs even if all external devices except the A/C adapter are unplugged from the dock.Disconnecting the dock's A/C adapter makes the noise go away, even if all other devices listed above are connected. Using the adapter with a different wall outlet (which, FWIW, tested as being properly grounded) or unplugging and reseating the cable between the outlet and the adapter does not fix the problem. The noise does not occur when the laptop is powered (through a barrel connector, not through the USB-C port) with Dell's included power brick.I also tried connecting the dock to an older (2018) Dell XPS 13. Similar CPU-dependent noise is present, though not as loud, when the dock's A/C adapter is connected. Also, that laptop, while it worked fine with the dock's HDMI port, intermittently failed to receive input from the wireless keyboard/mouse when connected through the dock as described above. However, I did not test the latter issue over a long period to see if it persisted.My observations suggest that the product, or at least the unit I received, has an issue with electrical noise related to its A/C adapter.  The sounds are bothersome enough that I am inclined to return the product for a refund.\",\n",

I have plenty of HDMI cables and most monitors or tvs include HDMI these days. So 2 HDMI ports are welcome! This dock has a very small footprint and is very portable which helps for travel and for shuffling around while working at home during these times. My previous dock was not portable.I like that this dock also can potentially multitask as the power supply for my machine via USB-C. So that is a nice bonus. 1 less outlet used up on the power strip.  I also want to use for my wife's macbook air, unfortunately, the Air only support 1 external monitor.  But this dock should support 2 external monitors on newer macbooks. Highly recommend.\",\n",

Sounds like their support is hit or miss- in my case a miss.I received this for a Christmas gift and finally got around to connecting this week. Went to install it and the part of the cord that goes from the outlet to the power brick was missing. Called tech support twice after getting the Amazon order number and they said they would get a new one and respond with an email....still waiting.In the interim I have an office phone that uses the same connector so plugged it in. I'm on Windows and it recognizes all the monitors- 2 external- which is great. I have a Dell computer. Updated firmware based on other reviews.Tried to use this to charge pc and have the one cord solution. Works sometimes but starts flaking out, sometimes immediately and sometimes after a bit. It does charge. My usb connection for my mouse gets glitchy too.We'll see how it goes  and hopefully I'll hear back from their customer service.If not, I like the idea and will look for something more robust to replace it.\",\n",
       "    \"This is a great little device, and everything works great on it. It's slim, it charges the MacBook, all the USB ports work.Been using this device for the last 6 months. A few things to note.- Other things to note, this does not have to be plugged in if you computer is powerful enough. On when my MacBook is fully charged it is able to run the hub without a power source. The benefit of the power source is that is charges the computer and you have fewer wires going to the computer.- If there is one thing that can be improved, it that there is a bottom and top. I would like to be able to put either side on the bottom. That said, the bottom does have rubber studs that keeps the device in place. Overall very happy with the slim profile of this.- Also note, this is a pretty heavy plastic / metal it does not feel cheap. It is pretty long, see the picture in comparison to the macbook stand, so make sure you have enough space for it.\",\n",

       "    \"A lot of time wasted on this product for me. I own a XPS 13 9370 and I was trying to find a docking station that provides high resolution for my two external monitors. I have one 4K monitor and another HD Monitor.Now, when I connect this docking station to my two external monitors, one of my screens would be at its maximum resolution and while the other is stuck at an extremely resolution (800x600 to be exact). I contacted the tech support number that came inside the packaging, and they told me my product was defective and sent me another one. But unfortunately, I'm stuck with the same problem.Please note that I have done my due diligence with the tech support in terms of other possibilities for the causes of this problem. This includes simple tests like as swapping HDMI cables, connecting the HDMI's directly to my laptop to ensure its not the monitor's problem, making sure my laptop supports this docking station (XPS so it obviously should), and many more. Also, using the individual 4k ports at a time works just fine. The problem occurs when I used both at the same time.So the conclusion is that this product is being falsely advertised. I am usually too lazy to write reviews, but I would hate to see other people fall victim like I did. It's strange because this product has relatively high reviews, and many people seems satisfied. So I am guessing this is a problem for XPS13 owners and if you need 4k simultaneous dual display.It seems nearly impossible to find an affordable docking station that supports dual 4K.

There was an error message in my Device Manager, and I thought I'd have to get a refund but it spontaneously started working again.

I haven\\'t observed any glitches with the HDMI video output, the laptop charges fine, and the USB-A ports have worked when I\\'ve needed them.My only complaints are minor, and have to do with the ethernet functionality.- A driver is required. This isn\\'t that big a deal in the short term, but it does mean that this device will eventually become obsolete when Startech discontinues it and stops updating the drivers for new macOS releases. (I had this happen with an Epson projector a while back.) OTOH, for the price I don\\'t need it to last forever.- Heavy network usage consumes a lot of CPU. When doing a backup over gigabit ethernet with this device, the \"kernel task\" process uses 100% of one CPU core. If you mainly use your network for accessing stuff on the Internet (as opposed to a local LAN) you probably won\\'t find this noticeable; it only happens under very heavy network usage.',\n",

It\\'s best to use one of the other three USB-C ports for power, therefore.  Then, it doesn\\'t support DisplayPort, so at least for my 4K monitor, you need a 3rd cable for that.

       "    \"If you have a MacBook with a USB-C port, then you may want to add a dongle that will allow you to connect USB devices. I have the 12 inch MacBook myself, and since it only comes with one lone USB-C port, I had to get a dongle to add some normal USB connectivity. I decided to give this dongle a try. I decided on this one because the USB-C cable to to body of this adapter is fairly long, giving me some flexibility in where I place the adapter. Also, it comes with an ethernet port, and a HDMI port, which means that I can connect my MacBook to an external monitor so I can use it on a bigger display.Of note, the ethernet will not work without you downloading a driver from the manufacturer's website. It is an extra step, but I find it works just fine when you have downloaded and installed it. It has two USB 3.0 ports, an ethernet port, and an HDMI port in all. There are other adapters that include SD card readers and so forth, but I don't really need those right now so it is fine that that was not included. For the price, however, it could have been in my opinion.This is a powered adapter, which means that when you connect a USB-C cable to this that is connected to an outlet, then the power to the adapter actually will power devices that are connected, so you could use this to charge a cell phone for example. Again, it would only work as a charger when connected to a power outlet, but it works well. For my needs, this has been adequate. You may want to compare this to other devices to see if you do want more features or if this will be enough for you.\",\n",
       "    'I have a three-month-old 13\" MacBook Pro that has four USB-C ports but no regular USB ports, so adapters are vital at home or while traveling. When I bought the computer, I also ordered a multi-port adapter with a good review from CNET.\\xa0\\n\\nSatechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Hub Adapter with Type-C Charging Port, 4K HDMI Video Output, and 2 USB 3.0 Ports, portable for MacBook Pro 2015/2016, Google Chromebook 2016 (Space Gray)\\n\\n  \\xa0. It\\'s similar to StarTech\\'s adapter but doesn\\'t have a direct Ethernet port, so I had to buy a USB-A to USC-C adapter separately for that.StarTech\\'s multiport adapter has the Ethernet port as well as two USB adapters and an HDMI port and doesn\\'t cost much more - less if you include the cost of buying a separate Ethernet adapter. The multiport adapter is black and small - about 1.5\" by 3\" and half an inch wide. (The Satechi is half the width and comes in colors that match my Mac, which is cool but totally unnecessary.) . Like the Satechi, it\\'s a pass-through - you  plug it directly into the computer and plug the computer into it. Considering how quickly Mac cords fall apart, this is a huge plus - less wear and tear on the Mac cord since you don\\'t end up bending around regularly.The StarTech is worth it for the ethernet connection alone, should you need it as I occasionally do. But there\\'s one more thing that puts it head and shoulders above the Satechi: its performance with Skype.I work with my collaborator all day six days a week on Skype as we write in the Cloud. Skype is picky and requires a lot of power. We often have problems with sound quality and after I received the StarTech I found out that a lot of my those problems are due to the Satechi - it stays connected but several times a day we have trouble with sound quality.  The StarTech adapter keeps our voices clear and there\\'s even less background static. I was very pleased and very surprised. I have retired the Satechi to serve as a backup or use to run my USB fan or anything else non-Skype related. The StarTech is now my primary adapter.A final note: I didn\\'t need to download any software to use the adapter with my new Mac. I did for my 2012 Mac, but it was easy. I have no complaints.',\n",
       "    'This is a high-speed multiport hub that plugs into a USB-C port on your computer. The device measures 3 ¾ x 2 x 5/8” and weighs 2.3 oz. It has a hard-wired USB-C plug on a cable that is 12” long. To use the device, you plug the hard-wired cable into the USB-C port on your computer. That is, in order to use this device, you need a USB-C port on your computer (only very recent computers have USB-C ports—check your computer’s ports before purchasing this device). On the same side of the device as the USB-C cable is a USB-C input socket for power. If your (laptop) computer has a USB-C power cable, you can plug that cable directly into this device and power both the device and the computer with the same cable. On the opposite end of the device are an HDMI port (for a monitor) and an Ethernet port (for wired internet). And on the side of the device are 2 USB-3 ports. You can plug a mouse and keyboard into these ports, or, since they are USB-3, you could plug external hard drives into them for highspeed connections. To use the device, simply plug the built-in cable into the USB-C port on your computer.This is a handy little gadget if you have a computer with limited ports. If your laptop, for instance, doesn’t have an HDMI port or Ethernet port, or no USB-3 ports, this little device will provide the ports you need. The device is small and lightweight, so it’s easy to take with you when you travel. It’s very handy for setting up a workstation either at home or on the road to use with your small laptop. Plug a monitor, Ethernet cable, full-sized keyboard, and external drive into this device, and you’ve got all the conveniences of a desktop computer, but you’re running it from your tiny little grab-and-go laptop. And all the connections run lightening fast due to the USB-C connection.',\n",
       "    'This adapter solves a problem many will face with the MacBook and new MacBook Pro. Both of these devices use USB-C ports, which is a standard that is also showing up on other laptops (such as Chromebooks and the Surface) as well. While there is some criticism for the new standard, it neatly solves some problems that have nagged laptops for a while, with a myriad of digital ports that do various things (video, USB, etc). Eventually things will move forward and external devices that use this standard will be commonplace.In the mean time, this adapter adds 2 USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, and Ethernet. It works great on the MacBook Pro, but this is because Apple chose to fully support all parts of the USB-C specification. This is not the case for all laptops that support features such as Video Out and USB Power Delivery 2.0. It is crucial to check to see if your laptop supports these standards, otherwise you will not get full functionality from the device.I tested this with a new 15-inch MacBook Pro. All features work, with the caveat that there is a limit on power draw of 60 watts. Using the laptop to surf the web and check email, power passthrough charged the battery. However, under heavy CPU utilization - where I compressed a 1080P clip in Handbrake while also streaming a 720p stream using Wirecast, the laptop ceased to charge the battery. Obviously, under these types of conditions it is better to directly connect the power supply to one of the USB-C ports built into the laptop. This situation may not be the case with a laptop that draws less power, such as a MacBook.Otherwise, everything works exactly as expected. The ethernet port requires a driver to be installed, but everything else worked out of the box (HDMI, USB). The box itself is fairly compact, and appears to be well made, with a sufficiently long cord for connection to the laptop. It is a really handy device to keep in a laptop bag, given all the connectivity it offers.',\n",
       "    'StarTech has a seemingly ever expanding line of peripherals and sometimes choosing the right one can be a bit of a chore. The port combinations of the hubs can be tricky, particularly for the non-technical. This well-designed and very well-made hub is distinguished by providing a DVI ort, Gigabit Ethernet and Power Delivery. You’re finding fewer DVI ports on newer machines, but with some older video projectors, in particular, its indispensable. There are also a large number of DVI-equipped monitors in the field. Likewise, WiFi becomes almost universal, there are fewer instances where Gigabit Ethernet is necessary or even provided. The one USB 3.0 Type-A port should, I think, best be used with a powered USB 3.0 hub for best results. The Power Delivery option is limited to 60 Watts. Finally, for use of all options, you’ll need a Thunderbolt 3 port. When it’s all said and one, if you need this particular set of capabilities, this compact hub delivers.Jerry',\n",

       "    'The new MacBook Pros come with four usb-c ports and nothing else (Apple giveth and Apple taketh away).  And yet most of us have lots of usb 2.0 and/or usb 3.0 peripherals. This Startech unit helps solve this problem by providing two high speed usb 3.0 ports as well as a 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160 pixels) HDMI port and an ethernet port.  The good news is that the HDMI port outputs both audio and video, although you may need to direct both the sound to the HDMI port in sound preferences and select how you want the video output to be presented to the HDMI in the display preferences.  The only problem I had was getting the Ethernet port and the HDMI port to operate simultaneously (I could not).  But I was able to have the HDMI port and the two usb 3.0 ports operating simultaneously with all three at full or near full bandwidth.  The unit did get quite warm to the touch, however, during this test.  The best mode of operation seems to be to plug in your usb-c power adapter into this unit, and allow your Apple power adapter to both charge your computer and power this unit.  During heavy use, your computer will be charged at a slower rate, but I never found a time when the charging operation stopped entirely.Curiously there are two green leds that can be observed through the air vents, but neither was acknowledged in the instruction manual.  One comes on when the Apple power adapter was plugged into the usb-c port labeled “dc in” and the other comes on when this unit is plugged into a usb-c port on the MacBook Pro.',\n",

But the Startech adapter does so much more.  As you  probably noticed, it has a network adapter and another USB port.  The \"power in\" port is right next to the black USB C out cable, which makes it less confusing.Also, the Apple branded version has been making a popping sound when I plug it into the TV and my Mac goes to sleep, curiously, this one does not.  (the popping sound goes through the TV speakers, the sound does not come from the adapter).Overall I think it is well worth the extra $10 for the extra features.

I used a windows based laptop it had the proper connector, although I had to borrow one of the new ones of my brothers temporarily to test, mine are a bit old.Because of the literature on this one I did not mistake the second USB C connection as an output, it's only for power input to the adapter in case you can't get it through your other connectors and need to power.  The HDMI worked nice with my LCD TV big screen, but it's not a 4K so I couldn't test it fully just to 1080P.  I like the Ethernet feature so when I'm on the road and I upgrade my laptop, I run into some hotels that don't have WiFi or it's poor and they still have a wired connection, ran into that North of Grand Haven last year at a Fairfield, property, they were going to upgrade, but the WiFi they had you couldn't steam anything, but If I could have used the wired it was better.

       "    \"I've struggled with USB-C devices in the past - sometimes they do what they claim to do and other times they don't. The StarTech multiport adapter works just as it says it does. The adapter connects via USB-C and provides ports for 1 gig ethernet, 2 USB ports and an HDMI port, along with a power port. It is essentially plug and play, except for the ethernet port, which requires a driver. I used a newer Macbook and everything worked as it should, though USB-C may not work the same on every computer, so you'll need to check to make sure that your computer can handle moving data, power and a display all at the same time.There is a limitation to how much data can move across a single port, so I definitely noticed a little slowing between the ethernet, a 4D display and transferring photos across USB. When I used it as a dedicated port (for just ethernet or data transfer) there was no slowing. This was exactly as I'd expected.In fact, the only trouble I found with this is that the adapter is a touch wobbly. When it was plugged into my computer, it was fairly easy to knock out. That's really a minor issue given the consistent, reliable transfer rates and multi-purpose function.\",\n",

       "    'I don\\'t have any external displays or TVs to test the HDMI output with, so I cannot comment on whether and how well the video-out works.The only computer I have that has USB-C ports is a 2016 MacBook running macOS Sierra. I\\'m also using an external SSD (one internal SATA3-based SSD in USB 3.0 enclosure) for backup and storage purposes.The good: Ethernet port works without installing any software/drivers. DC-IN (USB-C input only) works. Cord is 2-3 times as long as the HooToo hub (3x USB-A, SD card slot, DC-IN, no HDMI) I also own and use.The bad: like the HooToo multiport hub, the host device sometimes switches between charging and not charging rapidly. The DC-IN port here is rated for up to 60W - this will not work for the new 15\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The price for this hub is fairly high relative to the competition (1 star minus).The ugly: Okay StarTech, seriously. Your product made me LOSE DATA.In the HooToo hub, all three USB-A ports work the same way as the same port on everything else. Hubs, computers, power banks, wall chargers, you name it.In the StarTech hub, as soon as a slave device is connected and needs power, the USB-A slots go through a power cycle in which all existing power and data connections are lost, before returning to normal operation. **This is not normal behavior.** This unwarranted power cycle has the potential to corrupt data in external storage devices. If the host device also experiences the aforementioned charging-not-charging issues, the USB-A ports get power cycled repeatedly.In my case, I lost an entire partition full of Time Machine backup data on the external SSD, all thanks to this hub - and the only fix was to reformat that partition. This is unacceptable (2 stars minus).This StarTech hub, to me, is an overpriced USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet adapter with USB-PD. I\\'d have returned this product had the Ethernet port fail to work. In light of the data loss and high price, I\\'m unwilling to give this product any more than two stars.',\n",

The ethernet port is spotty (tried with multiple cables on a known router that works), the HDMI port makes your monitor flicker and has some sort of intermittent signal issue and WORST OF ALL is that only certain USB-C drives would mount on it. I have 3 drives that are all the same--same disk formatting, same storage space--and only one of them will mount on it.

I held onto it knowing I would get a new computer in the next few months.  I ended up getting an HP Spectre x360 with Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports.  At first, the dock worked for everything other than the dual monitors.  I reached out to customer service via Skype, and they were very (and surprisingly) helpful and accommodating.  It turns out the issue wasn't with the dock, but rather a compatibility issue between the VGA monitor and my laptop (confirmed when I used a VGA-USB C adaptor plugged directly into my laptop and it still didn't work).  When I swapped the old VGA monitor for a different one, everything started working beautifully.  I now have a VGA and an HDMI monitor plugged into the dock, so I have two extended monitors plus my laptop screen.  I also charge my computer through the dock (USB C charger plugged into the dock), which works well.I knocked off one star because the VGA plug on the dock is a shallow and doesn't have screw holes for a more secure connection.  The connection is fine, but it disconnects easily if you move the dock a little.  A rubber band works fine to hold it in place, but I'd rather have a more secure VGA connection without having to improvise.\",\n",

       "   'content': ['After getting the new Chromecast with Google TV, I was searching for an expansion dock to connect  a web camera for Duo calling, and an Ethernet port for wired network connection.  This UtechSmart 6 In 1 USB C hub fits the bill perfectly. It was instantly recognized by the Chromecast w/ Google TV, adding USB ports and Ethernet to the Chromecast without any action on my part. As a nice surprise I found that the OEM power block that comes with the Chromecast provides enough power for both the hub AND the Chromecast! I currently am using the Ethernet port  for network connectivity, one USB port for a web camera, and another USB port with a USB stick providing extra storage to the Chromecast. I would recommend this hub to everyone looking to add additional ports to their new Chromecast with Google TV.',\n",
       "    \"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I am using this product every day and it has been working.  I intend to keep using it and I would recommend it. But there are 5 minor things I experienced when using with a current model Catalina MacBook Pro.  I will document them in a quick video too:1.  it gets really hot.  This is typical of products that heat sink to the outer chassis, especially if it is metal and especially if you have all ports populated with active USB electronics.2. The connector is hard to withdraw from the USBC port because it fits tight and the handle is totally smooth.  Finger grips or surface knurls would make it much easier to unplug it.3.  When I use the HDMI output, for some reason my computer sees it as a DisplayPort device.  This hasn't caused any problems yet, but HDMI and DisplayPort EDID codes are not the same, so I can see situations where it could be an issue.4.  Every so often the audio over the HDMI output will not work.  I have been unable to track this problem to my computer or my TV since they work independently and with every other scenario I have tried.  So it must be the hub.  If I put the computer to sleep, the problem will be fixed when I wake it back up.5.  When the computer is shut down, sometimes the power light on my webcam will flicker.  This shouldn't really be happening since the power supply input is strictly for charging the computer and shouldn't be powering anything else.  So far it has not caused issues, but it worries me a little.It is worth the money, good size, good construction, so far I am happy with it.THANKS!\",\n",
       "    \"I saw the negative reviews, but what I wanted to do was to connect my power adapter to power my computer, but yet have USB 3.0 type-A ports and Ethernet, these are great. As far as the speed negatives, this is a hub, you can't get something for nothing, everyone knows that hubs are a compromise. The power is for pass-through. Power Delivery type PD is to use the type C power connector and if you have few ports on computers like a Macbook Air or Macbook, these are excellent. I work for an MSP so one of my tasks is to set up computers, particularly now with COVID a lot of our customers who will be working from home. I've set up literally hundreds of computers using these. Sometimes I'm int he middle of one when I go home, so even over the weekend, I've left them plugged in for 48+ hours over the weekends, with no problems.\",\n",

Being on a different site every day I need to be as mobile as possible they recently gave me a ThinkPad Yoga which is great for working in different environments but does not have all of the connections I need.This adapter is a fantastic addition to my tool kit. I work with Ethernet switches a lot and this computer does not have an Ethernet port. The UltechSmart adapter has that plus so much more. I use it every single day. It’s very light and extremely reliable. I have not had an issue with it once over the past few months.I also use it to connect my USB drive, TP link WiFi adapter when I need a second wirless NIC, power and HDMI.Great for traveling and connecting in the go.',\n",
       "    'I travel quite a bit with my MacBook Pro,  and the downside to the newer MacBook Pros with the USB-C port is the lack of other ports! While I’m sure it’s great because it decreases the size and weight of the laptop itself, it doesn’t allow for other ports which I actually use. It becomes necessary to find a hub/dongle set so you can connect peripherals.I purchased the USB C Hub, UtechSmart 6 in 1 USB C Adapter and found it allows me to plug in all my other devices. I has an HDMI port for connecting to a large monitor or TV, 3 USB 3.0 ports to connect to my camera and scanner, and also allows me to connect to my company network via the Gigabit Ethernet port. I can do this all while keeping power to the laptop by connecting my Macbook Pro’s USB-C power adapter to the USB-C input on the hub.While I’ve not had any issues with the UtechSmart 6 in 1 USB C Adapter, it really has freed me from having to worry about connectivity whether I’m at work or at home. The adapter is nice looking, it’s sturdy because it’s made of metal, and is easy to travel with because it’s not too big or heavy. I simply throw it into my bag with the MacBook Pro’s power adapter and I can connect at work, while traveling, or into my desktop with all peripherals at home.Since I already have an extra power adapter that stays in my travel bag, I just may purchase another UtechSmart 6 in 1 adapter to stay in my bag while this one stays ready and connected at home!',\n",
       "    'This is an effective product to add functionality to my Surface Pro 7. I have a Kensington case for the computer because I take it into the field occasionally, and this works with the case on without a problem. I have seen other options that plug in to both the USB-A (regular USB) and USB-C (phone-charger-style USB) ports to give USB-C passthrough functionality, but those wouldn\\'t work with my case. I use the HDMI port daily for a second monitor, and I use the ethernet port periodically if I have to uplink in one of our offices. Both ports seem to work without fail. The fact that each USB port on here is USB 3.0 is a huge selling point. The only thing I haven\\'t used on this device is the power-delivery USB-C port, but I\\'m sure it would work just fine if I tried. The unit is aluminum but feels sturdy without being heavy.There is one concern with this device for me, and that\\'s the cord. It is about 4 inches long from device to plug, and the device itself is another 4-ish inches. The port is 6\" from the bottom of the computer. As a result, the device doesn\\'t sit flat on the desktop, but rather at somewhat of an angle, and I believe that causes strain at the port plug. If the cord were just two, maybe three inches longer, the device would sit flat without any concern. Obviously this concern applies only to tablet-style or 2-in-1 computers, because laptops have their ports flush with the desk. But for me, it drops a star because it\\'s unnecessary stress at the port, which could eventually wear out the connection. (That\\'s supposedly not an issue for USB-C, but I\\'m skeptical.)Overall, best purchase for the money for my purposes. Would buy again, even with the 4 inch cord.',\n",

The quality of the product seems very good, no blemishes or defects in the construction. All the ports work fine. I was able to connect my Chromecast to the ethernet with no issues after I used a better power plug. Don't use a cheap usb to outlet adapter as it needs to have enough power to supply all the ports. I first used just a random one I found in the house and the ethernet didn't kick in. Once I switched it to an Apple outlet it worked just fine. I also have a 32GB USB drive plugged in to give my Chromecast extra storage. I was considering attaching a hard drive with my movie library which would have worked fine but with the ethernet running at full speed I'm able to stream the movies from my computer using Emby with no lag or buffering. I'm sure there are plenty of other uses for this device and if I ever need another one I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.\",\n",

This works great, lets me plug in my laptop cooling fan, power, and Ethernet all to this and then this plugs into 1 of the USB C ports on the computer.Its works great, I just wish I didn't need it.

The brushed blue/gray aluminum looks great next to my Huawei Matebook X Pro 2018. However, I can\\'t give the hub five stars since a month ago the monitor hooked up to the HDMI port on this hub started working intermittently. Basically, I would plug in the hub to the USB-C port and the monitor would not display my screen. I would then unplug the HDMI cable and plug it back in which would kick-start the port to work and the monitor would display my screen. Well, after a month of doing this, the monitor will not work when plugged into this hub. I have another hub that has HDMI for a two monitor setup with my laptop in clam-shell mode (sits on desk closed since it\\'s only 13\") and when plugging in the monitor that was not working to this separate hub, the screen is displayed. I changed cables as well. Again, I love this hub, but the HDMI port stopped working a few weeks after the warranty was up. Bummer.UPDATE: I was recently contacted by the customer support team and was THANKED by them for an honest review. Then they proceeded to offer me a replacement free of charge. Full disclosure I paid for the item myself, was not offered a discount nor asked to review my purchase.

       "    \"I use this hub with my new MacBook Air. The MacBook has just two (2) USB C ports but I need expanded connectivity to use the device efficiently. This hub provides exactly what I need in a compact, light device that's modestly priced:1. The hub connects to the MacBook with a short cable with a male USB C plug at the end. This leaves the Mac's second USB C port free and accessible. Other hubs I checked out plugged directly into the USB C port and covered the second USB C port so I couldn't use it.2. The hub has an Ethernet port. I much prefer wired to wireless connections in terms of both speed and security. Very few hubs I looked at included wired connectivity.3. The hub has three (3) conventional (female) USB 3.0 ports allowing connection of a wide variety of accessories such as a mouse (which I find to be faster and more precise than the touchpad on the MacBook, a card reader or a cable to my camera to d/l photos, etc.4. The hub has a HDMI port which allows me to easily use a full size monitor if I so desire.\",\n",

From then forward it has worked perfectly.The reason I prefer this one over the one missing the network port, is it seems to be able to handle the power draw demands more easily. The non network port version i have hooked up to the same laptop, but it sometimes cant handle all the peripherals. I resolved this by powering the USB speakers separately and using the headphones connection.All in all a great product and am happy with its performance.',\n",

The unused hub USB-C charging port does not work with USB-C connection devices, but I suppose it could be used to charge another device (like an iPhone), but I did not test this. The description was not entirely clear on this.+4 star:The Ethernet port works great (tested) and the 3 USB3 ports are very useful. In addition the HDMI port rounds off the connectivity to make it a great travel hub. When I plugged it into my Dell, it worked instantly without any drivers required (as far as I could tell).

The form factor is nice a streamline and the materials feels like aluminum.  The blue LED light is nice and subtle - I don't like it when the light is super bright - it ruins the night time atmosphere when I work late at night.Pros:- 3x USB A ports for added peripherals- 1x USB C for power- 1 Ethernet port- 1 HDMI port- Build quality feels sturdy and I love the streamline design- The connected USB C cord feels solid and thick, I especially like how the usb c feels inside the port - it has a nice bite to it, where it doesn't feel like the usb c will just fall out of my laptopCons:- The placement of the USB C power port feels like it was an after thought- The placement of of the HDMI port is also confusing- IF you use it like I do on the left side of your laptop or computer, the HDMI cord gets in the way of me using my mouse (not functional)Other than that - it's a nice dongle.

       "    '*If this review has helped you in any way, please click \"helpful\".  You\\'re awesome!First impressionsThe packaging.  Simple to open, unpackage and the product is plug & play.  The intention of the hub is to have an external \"cable setup\" so that wires aren\\'t all attached to your computer.  Rather, the hub allows you to have flexibility and consolidate the connections a little bit away from your computer, TV, etc.Pros1.  Mac\\'s are being built lighter, faster but without the attachments and plug ins that make connecting with hardware practical.  This hub allows you to connect manually, and I love that.2.  Small and compact hub.  Only about 6 inches long and about 1.5 inches wide, the device can fit in your pocket, pouch, carry-on, or any place really.  It hardly weighs anything too.3.  Looks nice.  Has a smooth silver finish, looks professional and will compliment a business atmosphere and image.ConsThe cord is a bit small, about 4\" or so, but because there\\'s plenty of room for my USB devices and HDMI, it\\'s not a big deal.

       "    \"I bought this to add some expansion to my Google Chromecast w/ Google TV. While the port on the Chromecast is a USB-C, you are limited in speed for ethernet to the limitations of the USB-C 3.0 specs.  That said, the stability is good and I get a consistent 300+ mbt speed with this hub. It's not reaching gigbit speed. But that's a limit of the Chromecast USB port, not this hub. I also added a USB 3.0 thumb drive to the hub for additional storage. While not a limitation of the hub, the power supply included with the Chromecast does not have enough power to support the hub and accessories.  I was able to replace the Chromecast power supply with one from a Galaxy 9 phone and everything worked well.  If you add additional devices to the hub, that may not be the case. It may require more than 2.0 amps.\",\n",

The placement of the ports is well thought out: even bulkier USB flash drives won't block the adjacent port.I tested the wired internet download speed on my laptop through the ethernet port on the hub, and plugged directly into my router, and there was no loss of speed with the hub. Data speed with a USB flash drive, and a USB hard drive, seemed as fast as when plugged directly into the laptop. The hub only got a little warm with extended use. It will probably last longer than a plastic hub, since the metal body dissipates the heat. The only thing I wasn't able to test was the HDMI output, since my laptop's USB C port isn't video capable.\",\n",

This peripheral basically gives you access to any other peripheral you can think of to use with it..... Expanded memory, wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, wired ethernet, Etc.... the new Chromecast model has no problem detecting the Hub and anything else attached to the hub.

It's extremely well made with aluminum that is a dead-on match for the dark gray MacBook, and the cable is thick. This is not a cheaply made unit.It plugs in using one USB-C port, and offers you three USB-A 3.0 ports, along with a HDMI port. There's also a very hand USB-C port directly above the cable on the skinny end of the adapter, so if you are one of those poor souls who have only 1 USB-C port then you can charge your device while using this adapter. For me that's going to be a seldom-used feature but I appreciate that it's there.I cannot speak to technical speeds or anything like that other than to say it's fine- I've used it for flash drives and hard drives and it all works great. Full disclosure: This company contacted me due to the number of reviews I've written on Amazon and offered me this adapter at a discount in exchange for an honest review. This in no way influences my opinion and if it was just ok or complete crap, I'd tell you as much. My reputation isn't worth a $25 adapter.

Works like a charm, at home, work, and at the cafe.  Extra thanks for the instructions for configuring my Mac ethernet driver, instructions which are easy to forget.  For mobile laptop use I don't need VGA or SD slots, but I'd get the bigger 11-way hub from the same vendor if I did.Follow-up five months later:  The ethernet jack no longer operates, so I'm deleting two stars.  The broken adapter is in my office serving as a docking station.  it is plugged into power 24x7.  I suspect these babies are not tolerant of being plugged in all the time.  I have a second adapter (which I carry around) and swapping them shows that it's the adapter, not the service or cables or computer.

Luckily, this product allows me to plug my computer into an ethernet port, connect to my printer with a USB to USB-B cable, and even save to my flash drive. It is a good product for a reasonable price and if you have a new computer that does not have the \"old\" USB-A ports, you will need this for your cables that are not USB-C compliant; which is just about everything. My only criticism is that the connector tab is upside down so that I have to flip the hub over to plug it in. The logo is on the \"down\" side when I flip it and this bothers me for some Type-A reason...',\n",
       "    \"I gave this 5 stars because even though it isn't perfect, I think any issues I've encountered are more likely a result of the hardware, software, and drivers I'm using.  TL;DR: It basically works as expected and I can confirm that it doesn't use DisplayLink.  I contacted UTechSmart before purchase to confirm if this device used USB-C HDMI Alt-mode instead of a DisplayLink chip.  They confirmed it uses the former and said that though they had not tested it with a Pocket 2, if it didn't work I could return it no questions asked.  Bonus points to them for that.  For reference, I'm using it with a GPD Pocket 2 (late 2018 product refresh using an Intel m3-8100Y CPU), running Windows 10 LTSC 2019 and a mixture of GPD and first-party drivers (mostly direct from Intel and Realtek).  This is not how it comes from GPD, and is most definitely NOT a supported configuration by either GPD or Microsoft.  I'm using the latest Intel drivers available (26.20.100.7000) from the Intel site.  The only persistent issue is that on my device, if second-screen mode default (Win+P) is set to duplicate or extend then neither screen will display when the hub is first plugged in.  After a few seconds one of the screens will start working again.  If the default is second screen only then it will work immediately.  Once external display is working, using the Win+P shortcut to switch to duplicate or extend works correctly.  This is most likely a Windows or driver issue.  For reference the Pocket 2 has a 1920x1200 screen that I use at 150% scaling and I mostly used 1920x1080 @100% scale monitors for testing.  No HDMI adapters were used and I tested with two different known-good cables.  Monitors tested were two Dell S2240L, one LG IPS234, and a Panasonic TCP50GT25.  I also tested on a 4k Samsung UN50NU6950 and it reported output 4k@30fps, which is close enough to the Intel UHD 615 spec for HDMI 1.4.  This hub can function without external power, but if you have problems, try connecting power before you connect it to your computer.  When I used it for the first time, it wouldn't appear to work without external power, but after some unrelated software and driver updates, now it does.  For me, this issue was definitely on the host side, not the hub side.  The network chip is a Realtek RTL8153 USB 3 to gigabit Ethernet adapter.  I own several devices that use this chip and it is serviceable, but tends to reset or drop out under sustained gigabit traffic.  This is a characteristic of either the chip or Realtek's drivers, and there isn't really anything UTechSmart can do about it.  (The other common providers of low cost USB->Ethernet chips (e.g. the ASIX AX88179) often have the same problems.)  Below max speed, the 8153 works without any problems.  As an aside, if you have one of these chips in a standalone usb adapter, you can plug it into a USB 2 port to get a trouble-free 250-350 Mb/s without having to babysit it.I haven't tried stress-testing how much power you can get from the USB 3.0 ports, nor have I tried to saturate the USB-C link with simultaneous video, network, and USB SSD file transfer traffic.  It doesn't really fit my use case for the device, and if doing so didn't work or caused the hub to drop connection it wouldn't necessarily be the hub's fault anyway.  One feature of the GPD Pocket 2 is that it can charge from any 5V source, not just from a USB-C PD charger.  So I tried to power the hub with a regular USB power bank that can output 5V@1.8A (Soshine E3S).  When charging directly, the Pocket 2 increases current draw until the voltage begins to sag below 5V.  This is normal behavior and prevents the device from pulling too much current from the charger.  But when I power the hub and indirectly charge the device, the power bank's over-current protection immediately trips.  For whatever reason, the hub prevents the Pocket 2 from noticing the voltage drop in time to prevent a fault.  A higher output 5V source, or a proper USB-C PD power bank would probably work just fine.  It's just too much for a smaller power bank.So in summary it works well, the price ($40 at time of purchase) is competitive with other similar products, and if I needed another I would start looking at UTechSmart first.\",\n",

Just plugged into the HDMI hub and then to my phone and produced native 4k AND sound! Tested with Pandora and YouTube. No noticable latency, either.Also, the hub accepts 3x USB 3.0 and allowed external storage from a flashdrive to my phone AND allows for USB mouse, when enabled in developer options. If you do any phone gaming, you may have an upper edge with a mouse, or if your screen is broken.Another really cool thing is that the hub has a female USB-C socket, which allows battery charging as a pass through (with another cable) which I was very surprised to see working.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the design and construction and functionality of the hub itself, and the Utechsmart brand in general.

I did not try power delivery as I don't have a 100W USB-C adapter handy, that would eliminate one more cable to the laptop.The metal casing is a clever ideal to dissipate heat for a fan-less design.Ports arrangement is convenient where display ports and USBC in for PD are in the back, while card reader and USB3 ports are in the front.Overall a great buy that meets all I need from a typical Dell or HP Thunderbolt dock that is typically priced at almost twice the price, and most importantly it is QUIET.\",\n",
       "    \"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I am a freelance creative director and I use a 2019 Macbook Pro for 95% of my work, which includes tethered capture for photography, Photoshop, Figma, Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve. It is absolutely essential for me to have dependable connections to my hardware peripherals, many of which have not yet made the jump to a USB-C I/O. This hub gives me the perfect home or office setup so I can quickly edit, review, and create without hindrance.I especially like having so many varied ports (2x HDMI and 2x DisplayPort) for the different monitors I need to connect to depending on my job location. The 12V power connector is very beneficial since I regularly use external USB storage that requires a power draw—the devices will run from the wall outlet instead of drawing power from my Macbook battery. It goes without saying that the card readers are useful and the LAN ethernet port is a welcome addition in case reliable wi-fi is not available. Having 5x USB-A ports (3x USB 3.0 & 2x USB 2.0) is great, though I'm unsure why they can't all be USB 3.0.Aesthetically, this unit is pretty good. I like the all-aluminum enclosure and piano-black front panel—the look is very elevated and complements my Space Gray MacBook Pro very well. The rubber feet on the bottom of the unit provide plenty of traction so the unit stays put on most surfaces. A couple of gripes: the giant QGeeM logo on both sides seems unnecessary and large, and the I/O connection labels on the unit are positioned vertically, so they are difficult to read when it is standing up.Overall, this unit is absolutely perfect for what I need. My search for the perfect USB-C hub is now over!\",\n",
       "    'I\\'m a multi-time QGeeM customer and this docking station impressed in the same way as their other products.  First, this is well-packaged with an impressive out of the box experience.  The hub itself has almost every port imaginable.  It also has a sensible layout with network, HDMI, Displayport, Power Delivery and other \"fixed\" connections on the rear, while putting connections you\\'re more likely to plug and unplug on the front (USB, SD card slots). Very smartIt comes with a power supply for the hub itself, but you provide a USB-C power supply (the same you\\'d normally use for your USB-C PC or Mac) and the hub passes that through.  So you can connect ONE cable to your PC or Mac and it charges and connects to all ports.  I also tested the wired ethernet port with my Gigabit ethernet and confirmed it can handle the full Gigabit speed, unlike some hubs that can handle only 100Mbps. This is a perfect hub for your home office, highly recommended!A few notes - You DO need to install the DisplayLink Drivers, which is VERY easy and once you do, it works perfectly to handle external displays- This supports HDMI and DisplayPort but NOT Thunderbolt-3 Displays.- When powering on, I notice you have to press and hold the power button to get it to turn on. Works fine, just didn\\'t realize the first time.  A short press does not make it turn on, have to hold for a moment.',\n",
       "    'Transition to work-from-home during 2020, I\\'ve had to purchase several different adapter cables, particularly because my home setup is a PC and my work laptop is a MacBook, so I was ill-equipped for all the things I\\'d need to hook up via USB-C. I picked up a few different simple USB-C to [HDMI, DVI, etc] adapters made by QGeeM this spring/summer, and all have worked great and held up well. Coming into winter, my company decided to go WFH for the long-haul, so I decided it was time to invest in a good single-cable docking station. When I saw QGeeM made one, I knew it had to be the first one I tried, and it turns out it will also be the last.The build quality on this unit is excellent. It\\'s got enough weight to it that it won\\'t slide around on your desk if you pull on an attached cable, but not so much that it\\'s cumbersome. The footprint is relatively small and the color of the outer shell matches the space gray that is currently standard on MacBooks.Connecting it to my MacBook, I was initially concerned because it didn\\'t work right off the bat. However, then I realized I should have installed the DisplayLink drivers before hooking everything up. Simply Google \"MacOS DisplayLink Software\" and the top result should take you right where you need to go (it\\'s on DisplayLink\\'s website, not QGeeM\\'s). As soon as I had that installed, everything started working like gangbusters.Connecting multiple power supplies to the unit confused me at first, until I realized that the one that comes with the dock powers the dock itself, and the other is meant to hook up your MacBook\\'s power supply so it can charge the MacBook through the attached cable. This makes sense when you think about it, and I like the idea that the charging for my MacBook is being handled by its stock power cable.What really impressed me is the ease at which I was able to get three external monitors to work without too much fuss. In fact, one of them isn\\'t even a normal monitor...it\\'s a video drawing tablet. Furthermore, I wanted to use HDMI for all three devices, so I attached a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter on the back of the docking station, only half expecting it to work, but it allowed me to connect my drawing tablet just fine! The one issue it caused is that, in MacOS\\'s display settings, I did not initially see the full array of resolution options that should be available for the tablet. But a helpful online forum suggested holding \"Option\" while clicking the \"Scaling\" radio button in order to open up all resolution options, and it worked like a charm. I don\\'t think this is a failing of the docking station, but rather a recognition issue caused by the Mac connecting through a dock/adapter combo.Oh, when you first hook up monitors, if they all show up as mirrors of the main display at first, do not be alarmed. I think this is just a default configuration of MacOS. In display settings, there is a checkbox for \"mirror display\" that can simply be un-checked, and then you have all your separate displays. Another reviewer said that this doesn\\'t work properly if trying to connect four monitors, but I cannot speak to that. If I ever add a fourth external screen, I will come back and update this review.If I could change just one small detail, it would be to have one of the regular USB ports be on the back. My drawing tablet requires a USB connection in addition to the HDMI, and I had to hook that up in the front. But as you can see from my photos, the cord feeds nicely under the dock next to one of its legs and should stay put that way. Certainly not an issue that would make me consider dropping any stars, just a personal preference.Seriously, though, if you\\'ve been searching for the holy grail of a dock that can truly run everything you need with only one single cable connecting to your MacBook, search no further. Give this thing a go. It really is fantastic.Oh! Last quick note: the power button has to be held for a few seconds when turning on and turning off the dock. It\\'s just part of the design, so don\\'t let it alarm you. Look at it this way: the dock is unlikely to get turned off by accident! Works for me.',\n",
       "    \"I have been searching for a quad dock that would support two displayport connections. Most docks I've seen in this price range do not. I expect that is because displayport is old technology. My monitors are old but perfectly usable. This QGeeM d6907-4xl dock is just what I needed *and* including many other ports I didn't know I needed! This little guy has it all and more. What really impressed me was that everything I connect to it works immediately. Some docks I've tried will not work when too many devices are connected. The mouse gets wiggy or the system gets unstable. So far, none of that has happened. I have 2 displayport monitors connected right now (one is out of range in the image) and I have verified that the HDMI connections work with my other monitors. My workstation gets interchanged all the time and the footprint of this dock makes it easy to swap devices in and out.My current setup is HP Spectre x360 laptop on Windows 10 v1909. Connections include a 2TB hard drive, external DVD/CD rewritable, keyboard/mouse, external speaker connected to audio port, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 8 Plus, and an iPad 6gen. Aside from having two displayports, the next best thing is the Ethernet port. The HP Spectre x360 has only two USB-c connections and one USB-a. No ethernet port. My internet speeds were ok on wireless but when I plugged into the RJ45 on the dock, wow, the speeds nearly doubled! I went from 265Mbps wifi download to 490Mbps! Upload stayed pretty much the same at 42Mbps. All in all, I am very pleased with this dock and I highly recommend it especially at this price point!\",\n",
       "    'This was my second docking station. The first one sent did not even turn on. I gave it another chance, took a replacement, and the second one did turn on, provided that you hold the power button for up to ten seconds, which seems long to me.HDMI ports do not work until you download the skydrive software, which, is a bummer if this is your work PC and you don’t have admin rights or a company policy forbidding downloading third-party software / firmware. DisplayPort ports with HDMI to DisplayPort adapters work, but the resolution is not as crisp as with HDMI from the PC to the monitor. Keep in mind that there is only one USB C port, which is a limitation if you are using it with a Mac. In general this docking station did the trick until my company gave me an HP cube docking station. I noticed occasional monitor flicker as if power was not always stable. Also, good luck contacting customer service. This is another company that does not want to work through problems with you with a human being. It’s a handy docking station when you need one; not much to complain about.',\n",
       "    'As working from home becoming common, I got this docking station to mainly switch between work laptop and personal laptop. It reduced from multiple cables connection to just one single USB-C connector (see photo 1). The single connector charges the laptop, outputs video display, connects to both mouse and keyboard, and plenty of available USB ports for other peripherals. A pleasant surprise was availability of an additional USB-C port to charge airpod pro, the one from my laptop had always been occupied by the charger in the past.From packing to the docking station and the cable, the product feel very solid and high in quality. The docking station has some non-slip on the legs, which prevent it from moving easily, it also occupies very small area at the corner of my desk.I normally just one 32\" monitor, but to test the capability of the docking station. I connected two additional monitors plus laptop screen. The device was outputting video to four monitors from an i5 processor (see photo 2). This is something I wasn\\'t able to do with just one video output from the laptop.Having that said, there were a few notes that weren\\'t intuitive and I was scratching my head:1. To turn on and off the device, the power button had to be hold down for a few seconds.2. The first time my laptop was connect through the docking station, it took a couple minutes before video shows up in the external monitor. Some setup or installation must has happened behind the scene. It was quick after the first time.3. To charge through the docking station, a USB-C charger had to be connected through PD In port.',\n",
       "    \"I use this dock with my Macbook Air, and it’s awesome. Having extra screens is so nice to be able to spread out windows and see more things at once. The dock also makes it easy to connect multiple USB devices as well as charge through Power Delivery while only needing one cable to my Macbook. It's also dead quiet, there's no fan noise or any coil whine or anything like that. The only thing to be wary of, I have a 2020 i3 Macbook Air, and I’m not sure if it’s capable of pushing all three monitors at full 60hz. I have 2x 2560x1440 screens, and one 2560x1080. The 1080 screen seems to stutter under intensive video applications, but I think that’s more the laptop than the dock itself. All in all, great dock for a great price.\",\n",
       "    'QGeeM 4K Quadruple Display Laptop Docking Station is a wonderful laptop docking station for my daily life.  I purchased 2 previous model docking station by the manufacturer with a full satisfaction and this one gave more features built in like SD/micro SD card readers and 2 USB2 to which some old devices can be directly connected to use.  This one is a power station with a great bridge for new connections like USBc, USBc charger, USB3.0 as well as USB2, the old connection.  Therefore, it is very convenient to work with any devices to directly connect and get job done.  Gigabit ethernet port built-in makes my home network connection stable and no trouble with unstable connection via Wi-Fi coverage.  Two HDMI ports built-in makes my daily works so easy by one cable connection to my laptop to work with 2 big monitor screens via HDMI ports.  The built-in 2 more DP ports make it a great potential for 4 monitors and even higher resolution displays.  I am looking forward to taking the full advantage of features built-in in the near future too.Lastly, but not least, the vertical design works well for a limited space of my standing desk.  However, it was noticed that it was not staying still when connected with multiple hard and heavy cables.  Also, the combination of the white LED light on the silver cover case makes harder to see if the power is on or off.',\n",
       "    \"I've had it for a month... Figured it's about time to do so.Took about 15 minutes to transfer from my old multi display. Some cable adjustments were needed, due to the different type of connector I was using, but that took no time at all. Reconfigured Windows display, rebooted, made final adjustments for my four monitors, added my external SSD drive, USB strips, and it didn't miss a step.It doesn't get very warm... Maybe like an LED lamp after you turn it off. I have at least 3 monitors on all the time, lots of external devices, and it does great.Drawbacks? It's awkward on the desk because of the weight of the cables... Which I can mitigate with new routing and cabling ties. But I've only had to reset it once, and that was after 20 hours of being on, without use. So... No worries. It's a workhorse.\",\n",

Also as someone else mentioned, you have to hold the button down for power and not just tap at once. This was confusing at first as I thought it was broken but you just have to hold it for a little bit longer than you think you might need to.\",\n",
       "    'This docking station worked great with my MacBook Pro. I did not test if it could handle four monitors at the same time (I only have two right now), but I have a feeling it will. There is something odd about this though. The HDMI has a higher scaled resolution than the display ports. I do not know if this is the docking station or something on my end, but normally DP would have the better resolution. Regardless of this, I did test one HDMI and one DP and am happy that I can use this with multiple screens.Packaging was very nice and the device feels like it is made with quality materials.

       "    'If you want to use a MacBook Pro with multiple displays, this is one of the only docks that can handle one cable to 3 displays.  I\\'ve been researching this for awhile because some docks are just usb-c, not thunderbolt, and can only mirror displays.  This product uses thunderbolt 3 so I believe that\\'s why its able to handle 3 external displays along with the built in Retina display.  I don\\'t have a 4th display to test, but according to the info from seller, it cant handle 4 displays for a Mac, only PC. If you count your built in screen on the Mac, you technically are using 4 displays.I\\'m using almost every port on this dock and I can confirm it works flawlessly.  The only issue I have is that sometimes my speakers make a popping noise when I turn my laptop on or unplug the cable.  I just turn the volume down on my desktop speakers before I do anything like unplugging. If anyone\\'s got a workaround for this I would love to hear!I also have a windows machine for work and this is also great for that.Im using2 HDMI displays1 Display port display1 Gig Ethernet (confirmed 1000mbps download)Charging PD3.5 mm Jack to desktop speakers4 USB-A for various charging1 USB-c to lightning for charging/connecting iPhone (cant really test but feels like fast charging through this port)^^all these are connected to my computer from the dock with 1 USB-C cable included in the box.  Its kind of hard to imagine how all that is connected through one cable, but its been really great.You do have to download the display link drivers and approve some settings to get this working properly.  One thing to note is that, you have to enable DisplayLink to \"screen record\" according to MacOS.  This is one of the privacy settings you have to approve in order to extend to multiple displays.  When you allow this, MacOS (Big Sur) doesn\\'t allow you to unlock the Mac with your Apple Watch.  You get a message on your Lock Screen saying \"Apple Watch cannot unlock this Mac while screen is being recorded.\"  or something to that effect.  Not a big deal for me I use my fingerprint anyways, but im sure this is a dealbreaker for some people.All in all, this is a great solution for any laptop with thunderbolt 3 connectivity.',\n",

The DP allowed for greater resolution options, but I am running 4 monitors in 1920 x 1080 and in 2 weeks there has not been a glitch.I used 3 other docks that was able to support 3 monitors but they would either go black, like I unplugged from the dock and therefore would reset all of my windows.

       "    'This is an awesome USB docking station / USB Hub!!  I did quite a bit of research when looking at docking stations, and I did not immediately consider this dock because it was more expensive than many other options.  The thing that convinced me to buy this dock was the video performance.  I wanted to get a hub that would support 4K video at 60hz.  I saw that many other hubs would only do 30 hz, which some reviewers did not like because it made their mouse look jumpy.  Some hubs would support one display at 60 hz, but when you connected two of them, then they would only do 30 hz.  This hub will support up to three displays at 60 hz, and a fourth at 30 hz.  The first thing that indicated that this is a quality product was the packaging, which was very nice, with a form cut high density foam insert.  After downloading the latest drivers, it worked flawlessly.  I have a 32\" 4k, 60 hz monitor connected to it, and a 55\" 1080P TV connected to it, and it sends the correct signal to each.  I was initially worried that it would send the lowest resolution signal to both displays, but that is not the case as it sends different resolutions to each monitor. Impressive!!  I initially was looking for a hub to make my laptop more transportable, since I had my monitor, speakers, and all of the USB ports filled, so when I wanted to take my computer somewhere I had to unplug everything and then plug them back in later.  I also did not have enough USB ports for all of my devices.  Now I have everything plugged into the hub, and I just need to unplug the USB C cable.  That is much easier and quicker.  As a bonus I got the ability to plug in my TV, which helps me see how pictures and videos that I am editing will look on a TV.  I would definitely recommend this hub to a friend.',\n",

I fully expected to use just the USB C IN port to connect the docking station to my laptop, and get power delivery to my laptop, as well as to get my external monitors and other peripherals connected to my laptop. Alas, that was not the case. The USB C IN port presents to your laptop all devices connected to the docking station, which is great (requires the DisplayLink driver... I used 1.3.1 on an MBA M1). However, it does NOT provide power delivery to your laptop. For that, you need to use another cable connected to the PD IN port and connect that to your laptop\\'s second USB C port.  This is disappointing and will not work for my use case.I guess I should have been more careful when vetting this product.

(Originally rated it for 5 stars)I left the laptop plugged in to the dock for about ten minutes unattended and when I came back, the ethernet connection to the internet was not working. I tried to disable and enable the ethernet adapter, but when I disabled it the adapter disappeared. I found the driver in Device Manager as: Ethernet_RTL8211FIt had errors with the yellow triangle. I tried to delete it and try to find it again, but no luck.So far, the only solution seems to be unplugging the main connection to the Docking Station and plugging it back in. It seems that it could be the problem regarding DisplayLink as the driver property shows DisplayLink as handling the ethernet connection.I took a star down because of this bug.-------------------------------------------------------------------------I use this hub through usb type c with pd enabled. No thunderbolt 3 on my Surface Laptop, but it works great. The hub is pretty tall, but not a biggie since the dock works without any hiccups when compared to other products that I have tried. I have populated all the usb ports, plugged in an audio interface, ethernet, using pd charger for laptop charging, usb midi keyboard, and displayport for monitor connection. None of them have any problems and it works really well so far.Something I noticed is that when you disconnect pd charger to save laptop's battery life, the dock goes through configuration again so I might just use my surface charger instead to use the dock setup more fluidly. Not really disadvantage though.Except a logitech usb webcam, everything works well with this dock. I tried other docks and hubs and figured that it was not the docks, but maybe the webcam itself, or my laptop's usb c protocol since the problem occurs when I  plug the webcam into the usb c port using adapter, hub, and docks. Using usb A port on my laptop solves the problem so it's okay!I will update if I come across any problems along the way!\",\n",

       "   'content': ['I have two 28\" 4k displays hooked up to this thing and, true to Targus\\'s word, they run at 60Hz. The machine I\\'m using with this dock is a Lenovo ThinkPad E570 (15\" 1080p display) with an i7-7500U and a GeForce GTX 950.The problem is that, if you do anything remotely taxing on those displays, there are compression artifacts or the refresh appears to drop to 30Hz. \"Remotely taxing\" includes things like opening the Start menu, moving a window around, maximizing/minimizing windows, clicking through emails in Outlook, typing in Word, and simply utilizing Microsoft Remote Desktop/RemoteApp. Simple office stuff, really. Also, the NIC\\'s transfer rates appear to top out at 20 MB/s (yes, I mean megabytes, not megabits), making it useless for transferring large files.I won\\'t even get started on Linux support. DisplayLink provides drivers for Ubuntu, and they only support up to 16.04 LTS (which is fine, since the other versions have shorter support lifecycles anyway), but good luck getting two 4k displays working without ripping apart config files, and good luck using anything other than Unity.My desk layout is 28\"-laptop-28\", and it works beautifully in Windows 10 build 1709 as long as I don\\'t actually use them, but doing actual work on the external displays is a chore and is quite laggy. If this laptop had Thunderbolt I\\'d have gotten an eGPU instead.',\n",
       "    \"I have this surprisingly small docking station hooked up to Gigabit ethernet, a 4k 60hz display port monitor, and a couple other usb peripherals. It provides all the power necessary to charge my 2017 Macbook Pro while under heavy use. In short if you are looking for a single cable solution this is the way to go. What I haven't tried is connecting a second 4k 60hz monitor through the dock as well. It is supposed to be able to push dual 4k 60hz monitors or a single 5k 60 hz along with the other peripherals.Where this differentiates itself is that it has the best of all worlds. There are other cheaper alternatives that can power the macbook pro but cannot drive a 4k monitor @ 60 hz (most do 4k @ 30hz which is a little choppy to my eyes). The alternatives that do 4k @ 60hz only provide 60w power delivery which isn't enough to charge the macbook while under load. Additionally most docks that can do 4k @ 60 hz don't include ethernet.Pros:  * This is fully detached from the laptop and you can sit it somewhere else so long as you have an thunderbolt 3 cable long enough (you should probably use one of the active/more expensive tb3 cables if the length is over 1.5 ft). Some other hang off the side and dont work well in my environment.  * Dual 4k @ 60 hz  * Gigabit Ethernet  * Power Delivery @ 85 wattsThe only hiccup I have had so far was after plugging/unplugging from my laptop many times my ethernet switch got confused and refused to talk with the dock. I rebooted the ethernet switch and then all was well. This was not an issue with the dock but rather my switch.UPDATE:After 5 months of working flawlessly it started acting up. First was monitor flickering which eventually degraded into being completely broken (not delivering power, ethernet not working, external monitor not recognized and external keyboard not recognized). I went through Targus support (which their online interface is pretty terrible but the people were nice and helpful). Eventually they had me ship the dock back to them (at my expense) and they shipped me a out a replacement.I just got the new one in and was experiencing some monitor flickering coming from the display port connection on the device. I switched it over to a Thunderbolt 3 -> DisplayPort cable and am using the TB3 port on the dock and that is gone.When this device is working properly its fantastic, however there are some obvious quality issues.UPDATE: Nov 12 2018After a few weeks of usage of the replacement it has completely failed in the same way the original docking station did. Nothing works and it is effectively useless. With the quality issues I would not recommend anyone purchase this unless you like expensive paper weights.\",\n",

I usually work with dual 22 inch monitors as well as a wireless keyboard, mouse and a bunch of other peripherals. I purchased a USB-C hub that worked but got extremely hot - to the point that I was afraid to use it. I ordered this and couldn't be happier with it.I could easily hook up a 3rd (and maybe 4th) monitor and have 4 USB ports left available. Having something like this increases productivity 10-fold for me. The top of the docking station also has small rubber strips so I rest my laptop on top of the docking station to keep it out of the way. Great purchase. It is definitely pricey, but you get what you pay for!  I would definitely buy this again.\",\n",

I was worried that it may be flawed, but I was able to get my whole my laptop setup to my monitors and printer fairly seamlessly  I did have to go to the Targus website, find the item I purchased and download some software, but that was easy.I have had the docking station for a few months now and I have not really had any issues with it.

Unfortunately, because of the fact I took over 30 days trying to make the item from RCG Wholesale work, my request for return was denied.

All the USB pass-through functionality works straight out of the box but you will need to install DisplayLink for any dock connected monitors to work. Being able to keep it under my laptop is perfect for me since it aligns the bottom of my laptop screen with the bottom of my second monitor. Added bonus is that it improved the cooling of my laptop too. I cannot say for sure whether it will work for 4k but I can definitely confirm that it supports 1440p and I assume it will indeed pass a 4k signal. Transferring files from my laptop's built in SD card reader to an external hard drive ran at the max speed rating of the SD card (160 MB/s) and reading off the external drive (USB-C ssd) did run at 520-540 MB/s so the dock doesn't seem to be a bottleneck.One minor complaint, having it connected hijacks all the audio even if don't have any audio out device connected to the dock (i.e. cannot use the laptop speakers). I assume there is a workaround for this but it hasn't been a problem for my workflow yet so I haven't taken the time to search more into this and it gave me an excuse to order new computer speakers which arrive in a few days (Monday September 9, 2019). I will update then if I run into any problems using external speakers connected to the dock. I highly doubt there will be any problems since it works just fine with headphones in the 3.5mm jack on the dock.

       "    'The only thing I personally do not like about this DOCK160USZ is Targus\\' choice to use the \"MicroUSB\" 3.0 style connector which is very thin and flat. I find this type of USB connector to be less durable than the larger nearly square type, and have had a couple external drives where the thin flat cable bends or breaks too easily. If this is going to sit on your desk in one place, it shouldn\\'t be a problem. If you are going to travel with this, be sure to always carefully unplug the USB cable so it never gets bent, and position it when in use so there is never any stress on that connector.I plugged this in and Windows 10 downloaded all the drivers automatically. Before I managed to browse to Targus\\' Support Drivers page to download the video driver for this DOCK160USZ , Windows 10 magically turned on my second monitor hooked to this dock. The driver that Windows downloads is slightly older than that on Targus\\' web site.It is in fact displaying 3840x2160 at 60Hz, confirmed through my Dell P2715Q On-Screen Menu which shows current resolution and Hz on-screen. I hooked it up via DisplayPort. The Dell P2715Q does not have a HDMI 2.0 port so through HDMI it can only do 4K at 30Hz, but its DisplayPort can do 4K at 60Hz. I don\\'t actually have anything around that is 4K with an HDMI 2.0 port. I know someone who has a 4K TV so I will try taking this with me to their house.I will update review further after I\\'ve had the opportunity to test all the ports.',\n",
       "    \"CONS:- the cord connecting the dock to your pc is very short, and it's proprietary so you can't get a replacement. I haven't tried using a usb extension, but I feel like adding another cable in the middle is probably not the best bet.- the DisplayPort cord is set up in such a way that you can't detach it without unplugging the dock from your computer (center cord in the photo, it has the dock USB directly underneath), which is a minor gripe, but very annoying when I need to swap that monitor over to the other pc (that the dock's USB can't reach...)- I got this so that I could plug my work laptop in easily & swap to my home pc sometimes, which isn't quite the right use case. if you're going to do anything graphic-intensive, you really need your monitors directly wired to your machine.PROS:- works! pay attention to the fact that your monitors need to come from different inputs if you do this. (one DisplayPort + one HDMI works great, two HDMI or two DisplayPort not so much.)- love that I can hook up my speakers- no noticeable delay/issues for keyboard or mouse- it's pretty small (but still kinda tough to tuck away, since it's bristling with cords)\",\n",

Bottom line for me, wanting to use my C port to drive a 2nd HDMI monitor from my laptop: Useless.Really wish these makers make it clear that their devices do NOT provide the Alt-Mode support. Then again, maybe I'm expecting something impossible but several places like CNET, PCMag, say such converters exist. Not all of these C-2-HDMI converters are pass-through but some actually do provide the video support. So they say. So where are these converters???Anyway, returning this and Amazon Basic one.\",\n",

       "    'This USB dock is wonderful.  I was using a Dell D3100 USB dock before and the Targus DV4K out performs it in every way possible.  The D3100 would occasionally lose its connection to the computer (I’m not sure if this was a Windows 10 driver issue or the dock itself).  When this would happen, I couldn’t just refresh the hardware in device manager to get it going again.  I would have to physically unplug the device.  Not a huge deal I suppose, but when you are someone that has to VPN into work and your laptop loses its internet connection (or has to switch to wireless, then back to LAN), it causes all sorts of problems.  VPN dropped when it chooses the wireless connection after the LAN is dropped.  VPN re-dropped when the LAN connection comes back online.  This hasn’t happened to me once with the Targus docking station.  I can verify that 60hz at 4k (3840x2160) is working very well over DisplayPort on an Asus 28” monitor.  This isn’t just a number either, there are very noticeable differences between 30hz and 60hz.  I thought maybe my laptop wasn’t powerful enough to run a 4k monitor while I was using the Dell docking station.  It was very jerky when I would drag a window from the laptop screen to the 4k monitor and I would see some bad mouse trails.  This is all gone now with the Targus.  You won’t regret buying this.

I already had the Targus Universal USB 3.0 DV Docking Station for my desk setup so I knew the DisplayLInk technology it is based on works well on both Mac OS and Windows, so with the drivers already installed this travel version worked straight away.  When El Capitan came out updated drivers were needed because although the existing drivers still worked for most applications browsers didn’t display properly so a good tip is to ensure you get the most up to date driver from either the Targus or DisplayLink sites.  The travel version doesn’t have the same number of USB outlets and is missing audio in and out jacks, but the plus is its size for travel and that it requires no additional power input as it runs off the power supplied by the computer USB cable.  There is an additional micro USB DC 5v power input which is apparently for gear with higher power needs, but the manual doesn’t say much about this and only says the adapter is sold separately.  I haven’t needed to test this aspect out but imagine any standard USB charger would do the job.  I would recommend this product for use with data projectors etc with either HDMI or VGA inputs and for giving an ethernet option for machines such as Mac Airs that need multiple adapters to allow these connections.

However, I replaced it with VisionTek VT4000 from Amazon, which was cheaper and better (and also not defective).  Here's an edited review I left for the VisionTek:This is my second try at a docking station.  My demands aren't particularly great.  I have a 4K laptop and two old 1280x1024 monitors to give me a bit of working space.  All my ports are 3.1, regular speed (5Gb), both USB-A and USB-C.  I don't do gaming or anything demanding -- just a ton of office-type work with lots of windows open.My first attempt (not the docking station I'm reviewing here): a Targus DOCK160USZ, which I bought from a major brick-and-mortar competitor for somewhat more than I would have paid on Amazon.  (I bought it there because I had a store credit to use up.)  This unit and the VisionTek have similar specs:  2 external 4K monitors at 60 Hz refresh, 1 Gb ethernet, 3.0 USB, sound.  Even under light demand, the Targus sometimes produced blocky lines on the external monitors.  The worst part was the Ethernet, which would only support about 2 Mb/s download, which is 1/500 of its rated speed -- insufficient to do much of anything on the Internet. After a lot of debugging, I ruled out everything but the hub.  I suspect the unit is defective - no fault of the retailer, of course.  I've seen favorable reviews for the Targus.Second try:  VisionTek VT4000.  I unplugged all the cables from the Targus and plugged them into the VisionTek.  After about 15 sec of PnP port configuration, everything worked.  Everything.  I still installed the drivers on the enclosed CD, which also had good instructions on PDF files.  (The Targus only came with a tiny piece of paper with tiny print and mostly universal symbols telling me pretty obvious stuff.  They honestly didn't need to kill a twig to print it.)  I threw up three videos on the three monitors, while moving the mouse and dragging windows all over the extended desktop.  No stuttering or skipping or blocky artifacts.  Then again, I'm hardly running 4K monitors, so I wouldn't expect any trouble.  Next test was the ethernet.  I disconnected from the WiFi I had been using and ran Ookla.  Download was 120 Mb/s, and upload was 10, which is really all that's available to me in my location.  It certainly exceeded 100 Mb, so it was running successfully at the 1Gb spec -- and about 60 times faster than the Targus.Problem solved.  Yay!  The Targus goes back to the store.\",\n",

It does not have the ability (or not that I've found) to charge my laptop while connected, but I just plug in my power cable to the laptop, so that's not a big issue to me at all.  I am extremely impressed.  Although I should mention that I had to buy this twice from Amazon Warehouse.  The first one came with incorrect parts.  The second one came with the correct components.  So I had to deal with a little frustration, but I saved like $100 by ordering from Amazon Warehouse, so that's worth it to me!\",\n",

The drivers that the dock uses to use more than just a single monitor don’t appear to be extremely stable and results in about 10 minutes of software troubleshooting before every session of desk work. Once I get it working however, I don’t have any issues for as long as my computer remains plugged in.Additionally, it would have been nice for the dock to have been weighted like most competitors. It is extremely light, resulting in my cables behind it tilting the dock so it doesn’t rest flat on my desk. A very minor issue but it definitely impacts the product experience. Overall, I’d recommend it for a computer with decent hardware that can handle multiple monitors and clunky software, but if you’re willing to dish out some more money then I’d point you more along the lines of Dell or Brydge for higher quality docks.',\n",

Just downloaded the drivers onto my GS66 laptop, plugged it into the Thunderbolt connection, and my monitors into the Plugable, and up and running in no-time. For any standard work, it works great. Drag and drop windows, multitask, everything just works, and the 6 USB ports are a great bonus. All for less than the price of the standard manufacturer offerings.Gaming IS possible, but with a big caveat - There\\'s going to be a slight split-second timing space between the monitors. I actually wanted to test to see if I could set up a triple monitor setup for iRacing, even though it isn\\'t advertised to be used as a gaming unit. It does work fine, but with just the slightest off-sync between my outer monitors and the center which I have set up as the \"main\" monitor in the first port. I actually didn\\'t expect it to work nearly as well as it does though, which is just another testament for how well it does perform. Definitely worth it, even more for people who need it for productivity and multiple window support!',\n",

This was an affordable option and works flawlessly! After an easy install of the DisplayLink Manager software everything was completely plug and play and I now have a powered solution with more USB ports than I need, *three* HDMI ports and excellent performance from the DisplayLink software.Don't be thrown when asked if you want to allow screen recording by the DisplayLink Manager- it's a quirk of the software that requires it but it doesn't actually do screen recording and it's well documented in the install instructions.

I pushed the display from the laptop to the Plugable in 2 modes: using the laptop's USB-C to USB-C on the Plugable; and using a USB-A to C adapter to the USB-C port on the Plugable. Both worked perfectly. I continue to use the USB A to C adapter only because my HP zbook laptop requests I use the HP power supply in the single USB-C port. I've attached 2 monitors via the hdmi ports on the Plugable, set them to extend mode for more working screen space - love the resolution, no flickering, very stable, easy to wake up the computer from sleep mode - no hassles. Using the laptop monitor as a 3rd display in extend mode also worked. Finally, I'm using 4 more of the 6 USB 3.0 ports on the Plugable for the webcam, bluetooth keyboards, bluetooth mouse, and charging bluetooth headsets when needed. This Plugable has been the absolute best option for using HDMI's and USB 3.0 ports to my advantage for an awesome price!\",\n",

I just have to plug one usb c and all my monitors, network, usb disks, etc,  it is all connected.

       "    \"I had used Plugable before and this is the 2nd Docking station I tested from this brand.Not much in the box, the power cable, the 90W power supply and a USB C to USB C cable and quick start guide that's not half bad. The quick start can definitely be improved.Some standard typical stuff like 6x USB 3.0 ports, headset jack, Ethernet, USB C (Thunderbolt 3 compatible) with 3 HDMI outputs. It should be noted that it can do only one 4K only at 30Hz and 2 standard 1080p outputs at 60Hz and it uses Display Link.Something very important to know right of the bat is that this dock only works with USB C, you'll have issues if you are planning on using USB A (doesn't matter if its 3.0, 3.1 or 3.2) only buy if you have USB C connection. It can charge host at 60W btw. So when using this dock with USB C, you wont need to use your own laptops brick anymore, this docking station would charge your laptop at a maximum of 60W depending on your laptop.Also please remember it only supports Windows right now, no support for MacOS or Linux.During the 2months I have tested this, I haven't had any connection losses or flickering, so I consider this dock very very reliable for work.Something new here is the Alt Mode (not so new now) that depending on your laptops functionality can send video through USB C (it needs to have USB C Display Port Alternate Mode). The 4K @30Hz is provided by converting the DisplayPort Alt Mode to HDMI 1.4 here so that's the only port you can use for 4K and your laptop should support it. All this and only 30HZ (this was the main reason I dropped one star from the review) So much complication and not even a good 4K after all.the 2nd and 3rd HDMIs are standard Full HD at 60Hz.I personally am not in favor of Display Link very much, the way it works by compressing and decompressing the data (simplified for the sake of review), it butchers the quality of the video and you certainly can't rely on it much with high refresh rate videos and definitely not gaming, regular office applications are ok but certainly don't rely on Display Link if you are doing a lot of video work. Another major disadvantage here is that since the video is compressed and decompressed in the transfer from the main laptop to the display (again, simplified for the review), many protected video streams such as Prime Video and Netflix can't be played using the dock which is a bummer.Overall, a solid docking station with multiple ports and lots of good features, also very reliable but still has some room for improvement.\",\n",
       "    \"I ordered this product because I wanted to try the docking station style home office setup. WELL..... The power cord for this docking station comes in two (2) pieces (much like a laptop).IT WAS MISSING THE SECOND PIECE TO THE CHARGING CORD!!! Ugh. Honestly.... I couldn't even use the product at first. I finally figured out that my laptop charging cord was compatible with this docking station so I used it to test out the product. The product did work once I furnished the other piece to the power cord. It could have been a quality control issue, or maybe not. I would proceed with EXTREME caution if thinking about ordering it.I am sure if I contacted the company, they would have replaced it (I assume) but it is around the holidays and I just didn't have the time to reach out to them. Since the product worked, I left it at 3 stars, but am disappointed in the missing piece to the docking station.\",\n",
       "    'I picked this because of its ability to do 3 displays. I was trying to make a triple display \"dock desk\" for my laptop for quick work where I just sit down for a bit and don\\'t want to get into anything on my workstation. However i Found that the triple display thing is a bit wonky.Requires displaylink drivers that bsaically are virtual monitor drivers over USB. This works well for spreadsheets and other slow-moving tasks but other than that its not the same thing as having 3 displays (video typically lags and things like games are obviously unplayable in any way shape or form). I wouldn\\'t even say that these extra displays are good for chatting because of the delay that exists sometimes with typing. It feels like the monitor has like 10hz refresh rate (sometimes).Outside of displaylink the dock is \"great\" in the sense that it provides all the ports I would need (or really anyone) and also charges my laptop (my laptop only uses 45W).

       "    'I love doing tech reviews and now that I\\'m working from home I was looking for a dock that would allow me to hook up an extra monitor. I saw this docking station and wanted to give it a try. If you like tech reviews check me out at \"Ondawire\" over on YouTube and Facebook where I give tech reviews on all types of cool gadgets.Pros:1. This dock has a lot of ports on the back and in the front. It has a GB Ethernet port and a total of 6 USB-A 3.0 ports with 4 on the back and 2 in the front. It also has a 3.5 mm headphone jack, 3 HDMI Display ports, and 1 USB-C 60W charging port.2. I tested the GB Ethernet speed and I consistently got around the 950s which is definitely a good thing. Here in Phoenix, Arizona the fastest Internet speed offered is 1GB down 35 up and it also consistently maxed at the 35 MB up speeds.3. You can utilize all three HDMI ports for triple display. I only use 2 for my job but I grabbed my wife\\'s monitor to test it and it works.4. My work laptop needs 65W to charge and while this missed the mark by only supplying a max of 60W, it still does the job.5. I had trouble setting it up and I can tell you Pluggables tech support was quick and responsive.6. I love how this Plugable USB C Triple Display Docking Station comes stacked with USB-A 3.0 ports. USB 3.0 is older technology (2008) but it seems to still be the standard on \"most\" docks and it still has good data transfer speeds of about 5GBps. USB 3.1 came out in 2013 and has transfer speeds tp to 10GBps and USB 3.2 came out in 2019 and has UNBELIEVABLE data transfer speeds of up to 20GBps. While 3.0 is still good, imagine if this dock had 3.1 or 3.2. :)Cons:1. For the price I wish at least one HDMI display connection had 4K@120 Hz or at least 60 Hz. This only has one HDMI display at 4K/ 30 Hz then when you plug up the other displays that 4K@ 30 Hz diminishes to 1920 x 1200. For the price of $150 that is unacceptable for me. I have $30 docs that allow 4K@120 Hz.2.For my personal computer, I use a MacBook Pro. Again, for $150 I do not understand why this isn\\'t compatible with Mac as well. Before I got this docking station I was using a different docking station that cost $59 that easily allowed me to switch between my dell work laptop computer and my MacBook Pro.3. I hate to keep saying the same thing, but again, this docking station only put out 60W PD. That same $59 dock I have puts out 100W PD.4. When I hooked up my wife\\'s monitor to let me test out the 3 display capability, there were times where one monitor with just flicker. I tried playing around with the docking station and settings and it just didn\\'t help. **I want to say that it did not consistently happen, but it did do it maybe every five or 10 minutes. At first, I thought my video card was going bad or something, but once I unplugged the 3rd monitor the flickering issue went away. I want to assume that maybe it was happening because it was just too much power for the dock to handle with 3 monitors running and 3 USB ports running at the same time. Just an assumption.Overall I\\'m going to give this a 3*** star rating. For the price of $149, this Doc should hands-down blow away my $59 docking station that I was using.',\n",
       "    \"Update:I recently connected this to my laptop's thunderbolt 3 port with a different, much longer usb 3.0 cable and I noticed the USB ports weren't working on the dock. The displays worked but not the USB ports.It turns out that you NEED a usb 3.1+ or thunderbolt 3 cable or else the usb ports stop working. I had switched to a longer cable because I wanted to put the laptop somewhere other than my desk but this limitation makes it more difficult for me.I'm not taking a star off for this since the usb c + alt mode implies that your device has a usb 3.1 or greater.Notes:Requires USB 3.0+ to use two of the displays.Requires USB 3.1 with DP enabled to use the third display.USB ports coming out of this are 3.0. There's no USB 3.1 port.My review:I have an older laptop (Dell Precision) that doesn't have USB C with Display port enabled.I needed a dock that could do two monitors without needing the display port. This dock does have three  HDMI ports but one of them requires the USB C with Display port enabled. I am still able to use the two other HDMI and all the other ports on this dock.This is my current dock now (I've gone through a few) and this is my current favorite. The funny thing is, I could have bought the Dock that was specifically for my laptop for half the price of all the docks I bought but I wanted a dock that was more universal.They also include the power supply which is surprisingly unusual. My other docks did not include the power supplies.The audio jack does both headphones and mic, like your laptop or phone's port.This dock is plastic but feels pretty solid. It's a bit bulkier than my other docks but it works better so I'm willing to accept it.Overall, I'm very happy with this dock. The only issue is that sometimes, when I move it around or bump it, the displays go out. I'm not sure if this is a bad USB cable to my laptop, power cable, or whatever cable but it doesn't always happen.FYI, Displaylink is the technology that's been used for most of those USB2 or USB 3 to HDMI. it's been around for a while and Windows should download and install the drivers itself.

       "    'No written review needed.',\n",
       "    'Works just like I need. Dual monitors with two hdmi ports. Perfect',\n",
       "    'Simple set up',\n",
       "    \"I had used Plugable before and this is the 2nd Docking station I tested from this brand.Not much in the box, the power cable, the 90W power supply and a USB C to USB C cable and quick start guide that's not half bad. The quick start can definitely be improved.Some standard typical stuff like 6x USB 3.0 ports, headset jack, Ethernet, USB C (Thunderbolt 3 compatible) with 3 HDMI outputs. It should be noted that it can do only one 4K only at 30Hz and 2 standard 1080p outputs at 60Hz and it uses Display Link.Something very important to know right of the bat is that this dock only works with USB C, you'll have issues if you are planning on using USB A (doesn't matter if its 3.0, 3.1 or 3.2) only buy if you have USB C connection. It can charge host at 60W btw. So when using this dock with USB C, you wont need to use your own laptops brick anymore, this docking station would charge your laptop at a maximum of 60W depending on your laptop.Also please remember it only supports Windows right now, no support for MacOS or Linux.During the 2months I have tested this, I haven't had any connection losses or flickering, so I consider this dock very very reliable for work.Something new here is the Alt Mode (not so new now) that depending on your laptops functionality can send video through USB C (it needs to have USB C Display Port Alternate Mode). The 4K @30Hz is provided by converting the DisplayPort Alt Mode to HDMI 1.4 here so that's the only port you can use for 4K and your laptop should support it. All this and only 30HZ (this was the main reason I dropped one star from the review) So much complication and not even a good 4K after all.the 2nd and 3rd HDMIs are standard Full HD at 60Hz.I personally am not in favor of Display Link very much, the way it works by compressing and decompressing the data (simplified for the sake of review), it butchers the quality of the video and you certainly can't rely on it much with high refresh rate videos and definitely not gaming, regular office applications are ok but certainly don't rely on Display Link if you are doing a lot of video work. Another major disadvantage here is that since the video is compressed and decompressed in the transfer from the main laptop to the display (again, simplified for the review), many protected video streams such as Prime Video and Netflix can't be played using the dock which is a bummer.Overall, a solid docking station with multiple ports and lots of good features, also very reliable but still has some room for improvement.\",\n",
       "    \"I ordered this product because I wanted to try the docking station style home office setup. WELL..... The power cord for this docking station comes in two (2) pieces (much like a laptop).IT WAS MISSING THE SECOND PIECE TO THE CHARGING CORD!!! Ugh. Honestly.... I couldn't even use the product at first. I finally figured out that my laptop charging cord was compatible with this docking station so I used it to test out the product. The product did work once I furnished the other piece to the power cord. It could have been a quality control issue, or maybe not. I would proceed with EXTREME caution if thinking about ordering it.I am sure if I contacted the company, they would have replaced it (I assume) but it is around the holidays and I just didn't have the time to reach out to them. Since the product worked, I left it at 3 stars, but am disappointed in the missing piece to the docking station.\",\n",
       "    'I picked this because of its ability to do 3 displays. I was trying to make a triple display \"dock desk\" for my laptop for quick work where I just sit down for a bit and don\\'t want to get into anything on my workstation. However i Found that the triple display thing is a bit wonky.Requires displaylink drivers that bsaically are virtual monitor drivers over USB. This works well for spreadsheets and other slow-moving tasks but other than that its not the same thing as having 3 displays (video typically lags and things like games are obviously unplayable in any way shape or form). I wouldn\\'t even say that these extra displays are good for chatting because of the delay that exists sometimes with typing. It feels like the monitor has like 10hz refresh rate (sometimes).Outside of displaylink the dock is \"great\" in the sense that it provides all the ports I would need (or really anyone) and also charges my laptop (my laptop only uses 45W). In testing this with a pixelbook Go; I couldn\\'t get the other screens to really work.

       "   'content': ['Update to review below: I’ve reduced my rating to a single star. Why? I’ve now found that running devices through this docking station significantly reduces performance and often leads to significant lag. The docking station acts as a bottle neck to internet speed and the output of connected devices. It’s a fairly costly device, and I would not recommend it...Also disappointing customer service to address the foregoing issues. ThanksPrior review: Used as a docking station for business computer. Still analyzing the unit, but immediately noticed that running an Ethernet cable through the dock  (vs directly into the computer) drastically reduces internet download speed, and using the dock makes night light feature in Win 10 pro unusable.',\n",
       "    'After it became clear that this pandemic wasn\\'t going away any time soon, and I would be working from home for at least the foreseeable future, I decided I needed a better setup than just plugging a monitor into my laptop. I decided to try to duplicate as closely as possible the setup I have at my office. I spent a bunch of time and energy researching docking stations and finally settled on this one for a handful of reasons:1) the HP docking station I have at the office is ridiculously expensive and i didn\\'t want to spend that much money;2) I wanted a docking station that would charge the laptop without a separate power cord plugged into either the dock or the laptop;3) it has 4 USB 3.0 ports instead of the usual 2, plus two USB-C ports;4) it supports dual HDMI monitors, plus dual 4K monitors if I decide to upgrade later; and5) it was featured on PC Magazine\\'s best Windows 10 laptop docks for 2020.I\\'ve been using it for a few days now and it\\'s been working great. Can\\'t find much at all to complain about. The negative reviews I\\'ve seen have mostly been compatibility with Macs, and I can\\'t speak to that, but it works perfectly well with the three Windows 10 laptops I have: an HP Elitebook, a Lenovo Ideapad; and a Huawei Matebook, it also works great with my kids\\' Chromebook. All installed the docking station without drama, and dock seamlessly when plugged in. The only issue I\\'ve seen is that the Huawei laptop doesn\\'t support Thunderbolt, so I do get a notification every time I plug it in that the device isn\\'t \"fully supported\" but it works just fine otherwise. 60w charging is more than adequate on all three machines.To address another negative review I saw-- I\\'ve noticed absolutely no decrease in internet download speeds, nor have I noticed any lag. My wireless keyboard and mouse work perfectly as well, with no obvious signal delay. I\\'m using this strictly for business applications, and the occasional web browsing. I cannot speak to how this may or may not affect gaming. The only possible complaint I might have is that the docking station I have at the office has a button to \"wake up\" the laptop from sleep mode without having to open the lid. This does not have one. It\\'s only a minor inconvenience when you first plug in a sleeping laptop. If you have your power settings to stay on with the lid closed while plugged in, as long as you remain docked, it\\'s not a problem. Occasionally bothersome, but not enough to dock any stars.Overall, I\\'m very happy with my purchase. I can\\'t think of anything I need this to do that it doesn\\'t do. Yeah it\\'s not the cheapest option out there, but I couldn\\'t find a cheaper one that did everything I wanted it to do. Good buy.',\n",
       "    'This dock does not work on a MacBook running Catalina. Should be a plug and play device but is not even recognized when plugged in. The packaging states drivers may be needed and when trying to visit their website, the page for drivers did not even exist. I promptly returned this item and would recommend not purchasing.',\n",
       "    'This was the forth docking station that I have purchased.  I had one issue or another with the prior three.  I am able to connect a Macbook Pro 13 2019 with single USB-C connection.

It is as advertised properly powering the Surface Pro 7 via the attached USB-C, so only one connection needed.  Audio with no crackling also sounds good.  Cannot speak to how it works with 4K or 5K yet, nor the gigabit Ethernet, but with only a few display setting changes, it was fully functional in only a few minutes out of the box.

       "    \"So, I looked at a lot of these docks.  This one certainly had the most ports and it works great for the most part.  It's fairly large and has a big power supply, but that would be normal because of the 60W of power delivery.  Speaking of, the PD works great.  I don't notice it over-charging my MBP or anything terrible like that and it will also charge a number of other devices.  I have a FHD external webcam connected as well and there are no latency issues.The only real gripe that I have is that this requires the screen recording feature to be on at all times.  Fortunately, the MBP doesn't struggle with processing, but I imagine it's a little bit more work for the CPU.  I also only notice that 125MB of RAM, but the CPU is typically in the 15% range.  So, that's quite significant.  Also, since screen recording is being used, I can not use my Apple Watch to unlock the computer.  It's a minor inconvenience but it's also the complete loss of a feature.All in all, it's good for the money, but I think I'm going to spend a little bit more and get an eGPU for the displays.  For another couple hundred, I can also have dedicated graphics, it seems like a no brainer.\",\n",

       "   'content': ['With the Covid situation going on, I am working from home and I needed a docking station for configuring a dual display set up. I had a startech docking station in office and The office desktop support folks recommended startech for my personal macbooks.I got a loaner from office but it had a TB3 cable and didn’t support my MacBooks. I have a 2017 MacBook with USB C and a 2015 MacBook Pro with USB A. I needed a docking station that could support both.On a whim, I started a chat with the tech support on the startech website. The guy was very knowledgeable and really patient in answering my questions and recommended this docking station instead of buying a bunch of adapters.Although @ $300 this is on the high end and pricy, I decide to give it a try. I configured all peripherals and downloaded the displaylink beta 0.5 version(latest) for OSX 10.15.4.The display works like a charm. Although I am having some problems with the sleep(clamshell) mode of Mac( my laptop locks after a few second after I shut the screen and upon unlocking it, again locks it after a few seconds. The right configuration is done in the energy saver ) I don’t have any complains about the docking station so far.It does support both the 2015 and 2017 MacBooks.Also I have tested it with a windows laptop with TB3 port and it works fine.PS: I will post an update, when I figure out the issue with the laptop locking down.This does seem like a great universal docking station.',\n",
       "    'NOT sure what is wrong with these so called \"Powerful\" Docks. at this cost of the item, they don\\'t even do the basic minimum job of a much cheaper hub that i have been using; This is the fourth dock i am trying out - having tried the caldigit, another stardock, and 2 dell docks; i am beginning to regret buying a USB-C based laptop; however the small ICZI 8-1 hub is working the most reliable of the lot!',\n",
       "    '\"Universal\" anything usually isn\\'t, but this docking station truly lives up to its name. It works equally well with my work laptop (Microsoft Surface Laptop), home laptop (HP Spectre) and my MacBook Pro. My previous docking station was wonky at best with my home laptop and non-functional with my Mac. You can save a few bucks and go with another brand, but of you want a true plug-and-play docking station spend the money and buy this one.',\n",
       "    'I did get on the website and download/install the drivers. Nope. Nothing worked. Some people who wrote reviews said that \"tech support was great\". Well OK, but when I spend this much money, I expect it to work out of the box and it didn\\'t. None of the ports worked - not even the USB ! This item is on it\\'s way back (I returned it).',\n",
       "    'It works perfectly!',\n",
       "    \"I'll take you through my experience before getting into the nitty gritty specs. For this review, I grabbed my Dell Inspiron gaming laptop with thunderbolt port to test it out. It has a 7700HQ cpu so it should have new enough standards to do a good review on. I plugged in my keyboard and mouse, ethernet, and both my 4K monitors(both displayport). First, it took a minute or so for the displays or the laptop to even realize that they could communicate. The keyboard and mouse worked immediately and the displays did eventually figure out what was going on and turn on. Then I also got a pop-up saying that the cable I plugged in does not support charging. I suspect this is because the laptop knows it can pull more than the type c cable can supply, with it being a gaming laptop with a 1060, so the function is blocked by Dell. No problem. Now, lag. Definitely lag. I discovered that the thunderbolt port is not connected to the dedicated graphics card, meaning my cpu was hammering itself to supply dual 4K outputs and the included laptop display. So, no need to test it for gaming. Along with that is the inconsistency in performance on screen. It just doesn't feel smooth, and there's a little delay to it. I feel that that was from the cpu getting hit by everything I did, and the fact that the igpu has to pre-render the display and send that info over a usb connection. The ethernet on the hub did great, and was giving me the same latency as the onboard connection, and I had no issues with the mouse and keyboard.This hub does have a lot of features:2x USB 3.0 Type A ports1x Type C Gen 1 connection to laptop (Max 60W power delivery to laptop)1x RJ-45 Ethernet2x Displayport 1.2 ports2x HDMI 2.0 Ports(Only 2 of the 4 display outputs can be used at a time)Powered by an external power brick to AC power1x USB Type A charging port (Front)1x USB Type C charging port (Front)Comes with AC power adapter and Type C to Type C cable to plug into laptopBuild Quality:Build was pretty solid. It felt heavy and I have confidence that it will last. Definitely a strong side for this product. Ports felt nice and tight and captive connectors clicked in. The power cable, I think, is overkill. This thing looks nearly as thick as the power cable I got with my 850W power supply for my desktop.Use Case:So, who is this product actually for? Most likely Notebook users with macbooks or notebooks that just don't have other connections. I could see how having a station set up for a notebook with this would be hugely beneficial. Having full displays, keyboard and mouse, and an ethernet cable that might not be on the notebook at all bundled into a single package is pretty convenient. I know it's a hassle to hook up my gaming laptop when I have to take it somewhere and bring it back.Price:Here's the kicker. This thing is so expensive for what it is. At the time I'm placing this I believe it was $230. I have seen other Type C hubs for $100 that can do (almost) everything this one can do. Also, this hub is Gen 1, not Gen 2. The only real factor that could increase the value of this product over others is having all the display outputs. Looking at cheaper options I typically only see a single display output, or just a displayport and hdmi combo. If you NEED this feature, yes this could end up being what you need. And you will be paying to have it. For most users, I would say to shop for hubs around the $100 mark.\",\n",
       "    'My husband makes a living by trading and is also electronics snob and we are both passionate gamers so reliable internet and 4K monitors are a must. We set up his computer and 4 K monitors and here is what I can share:This docking station is a very powerful workstation and if you don’t need all of its features it’s going to be overkill and clearly waste of your money. However, if you DO need/want to connect 2 - 4K monitors, ability to charge your laptop and all of your peripherals with just one single cable being plugged into power outlet and everything else into this docking station that this is it. You can also lock it up so nobody is messing with your stuff.Here is the inventory and all that this monster docking station can supportFront :USB-A Charge Port - USB 3.1 Gen 1 transmits POWER OR DATA and you can charge a mobile device (7.5W)USB-C Charge Port - USB 3.1 Gen 1 transmits POWER OR DATA and you can charge a mobile device. (15W)Audio Input/Output Port – for Headset or SpeakersPower buttonBack:DC Power Input Port – this is where you connect the Power Adapter to supply power to this monster station.USB-C Host Port - USB 3.1 Gen 1 / Power Delivery 3.0Video 1 DisplayPort Port - DisplayPort Version 1.2 for a DisplayPort Enabled Display DeviceVideo 1 HDMI Port - HDMI Version 2.0 for HDMI Enabled Display DeviceVideo 2 DisplayPort Port – version1.2 for a second DisplayPort Enabled Display DeviceVideo 2 HDMI Port version 2.0 - for a second HDMI Enabled Display Device1 Ethernet Port – for wired internet. If you are serious about your internet connection you already know importance of wired internet AKA Wifi sucksUSB-A Peripheral Ports - USB 3.1 Gen 1 – you can connect your mouse or a keyboard.As you can tell from the above there is a good reason to call it a monster docking station. Coming from a StarTech, trusted brand and pioneer in the field, 3 yr warranty and most importantly, considering everything it can do I can justify the price tag. I don’t appreciate overpriced products but I searched the market for a product that offers all these features and I wasn’t very successful finding anything much more affordable.',\n",
       "    'Like most people I have had both the desktop computer set up that I use at home and a laptop that I use while on the go. I was tired of losing files on one and not being able to transfer them when I need them to the other, or starting projects on one and having to restart them on another. I word this docking station after my desktop computer finally died. I recently upgraded to a MacBook, and decided this would be enough computing power for all of my needs. This doc you station was the perfect solution for me. While I travel watch for work and I enjoy the slick small style my laptop, While at home I enjoy working on my two large HDMI monitors. I also enjoyed being able to use the keyboard and mouse as well as several other USB devices. The Stockton station has transformed my laptop into two computers. I can work seamlessly on projects at home and on the go. The resolution on both monitors from my laptop has been tremendous clearly 4K HD quality. Everything connects with ease and a simple plug and play.I’ve had no problems with lag or any delay from the laptop is running at once. Very happy with this decision.',\n",
       "    \"I want to be upfront with this review.  I do not own a 4K monitor.  I cannot comment on how this unit performs with one, never mind two, but I did notice something that might impact that.I ordered this unit to serve as hub for my laptop.  I wanted to be able to easily and quickly transition it to a full work station.  This unit works very well in that regard.Here is what I was look for:Q - Will it switch you from wifi to hardwired?A - Yes.Q - Will it allow you to shut your laptop and use it like a desktop?A - Yes, you have to play with your display settings, but it can do this.Q - Can I run dual monitors?A - No problem at all.  You get two HDMI and two Display Ports.Q - Will this charge my phone?A - Yes.  Most of the plugs will work for that.Q - Can I hook up a keyboard and mouse?A - Very easily.  Just use any of the USB ports.Q - Can you secure this unit?A - Yes.  There are multiple security options to lock this down if you are in a non-private work area.Other things to point out:1 - you get two plugs.  One regular and one that looks like it's designed for a high draw outlet, like an oven.  Could be an OS format.2 - This thing is solid with a bottom that girps.3 - Before using this unit, I would strongly recommend you go to the StarTechs website and download the driver.  It tells you right in the instructions to do that.  I did it upfront since hardware like this can drive you insane if you are not running it with a good driver.4 - For the people running this for two 4K or a single 5K monitor - I noticed that windows could not detect the resolution when using an HDMI.  I don't have a display port, so that might be the problem right there.  I just wanted to mention that in case it is an issue.Is this worth it?Maybe.  At this price point it's really hard to recommend for anyone not using 4K monitors.  I gave it four stars because it's well built and does what I want it too, but I bet I could get the same results with a much cheaper unit.  At least this is future proof for me. I do hope to get a good 4K or 5K cinema display for my office.  When I do, I'll make sure to update this review with my experience with that.\",\n",
       "    'This dock is pretty useful to have considering a lot of PC such as the mac and such are switching to type C plugs. What is nice about this is that you are able to use the adapter provided to plug into a type A. Be aware that type A seems to be a hit or miss if it provides a stable video connection to two screens. This particular device comes with nice type C cable which unfortunately is not a very long type c cable. What is nice about this cable is that it has an attached type C to type A adapter so you do not have to worry about losing it. The cable length however means it has to be really a bit close to your laptop. Although you can use this with a desktop this is ideally to allow your laptop to able to connect to multiple monitors plus you can easily put it directly under your monitor. This does require external power to allow for the device to work however if you device uses type C to charge this will also charge your device while plugged in. First thing right off the bat, is that this product can be used to power on your device from what I can tell however this may vary based on laptop model. It has two 3.0 usb ports on the back for fast transfer, two type C, and one 3.1 in the front for fast charging and easy access to data transfers. The device does have a power light indicator to show if the device is powered on. It is not too bright where it is a bother but it really is the only way to show if the device is actually on. The type c cable can be changed out for another and replaced easily if you happen to need a new or longer cable. The type C does also do charging if you require. The devices only has either type c, HDMI, or display for video output which is quite annoying. I would prefer display port but that is okay. The video quality is great. It really keeps video quality standard. It does get a bit warm when it is in use. Another thing I would say about this device is that it provides you additional usb 3.0 slots which allows you plug in several different devices as well as maintain a good speed of transfer. The device is actually a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The dock is fairly small and is a fairly light. It is very easy to plug into and the design is very simple. It does have a sleep mode so when it is not in use it will shut off and also the power button is not too sensitive but does not require to be pushed down too hard. The outer metal is a bit easy to scratch and notice so be careful. Overall I think this station is great if you require a dual monitor setup and additional USB ports especially with laptops that only have type c now.',\n",
       "    'Note: If you are using Windows, Linux, or MacOS with this product, I would recommend you to go to the manufacturer\\'s website and download the driver there in advance.  This will save you a lot of headaches with configuration.Startech always makes outstanding quality-of-life additions to computers, and this is no exception.  For most ultrabooks, they tend to be port deprived in exchange for portability.  This docking station is there to restore that functionality when portability is not needed as much as features.  Using one USB-C connection, you get access to multiple USB-A, a 3.5\" Aux, and HDMI and DisplayPorts to use that you may not have had with your original configuration.  There is a security lock as well if you want to tie this down, although you will end up having to buy a separate bracket if you want to mount this.There are two software enhancements with the driver installation.  You can do Power-Over-Lan and also remote security access into your laptop through the dock if you have the driver installed, enabled, and your laptop is connected.  This is a very heavy product, and it is not as portable as I would expect with these devices, but on the other hand, the functionality is pretty much unparalleled.',\n",
       "    \"My husband’s job entails computers and other forms of electronics. I know when I see computer items that I need to ask if it’s something he could use. This one was something he was very excited about. After recently upgrading to a high-end laptop, he wanted this docking station specifically for the dual 4k monitor support in his home office. It effectively makes his laptop into a desktop workstation and being able to power and charge it through the Thunderbolt port lets him leave his power brick plugged in by his recliner. It worked right out of the box with Windows 10 and didn't require any drivers. The Ethernet jack stays plugged into the gigabit switch that his file server sits on and makes backups fast and easy. He also leaves his dedicated headphones plugged into the audio jack so he can just sit down and put them on, and the USB-C charging port on the front powers his wireless charging pad. Having both HDMI and DisplayPort outputs for each monitor is a bonus because he really likes the versatility. He loves this, and we highly recommend it!\",\n",
       "    \"Currently, I'm using this for the laptop that I need for work. Overall since I got everything working I have been happy with it. I can come home hook up the one cable and have everything up and running in seconds. I have not noticed any drop in quality to my monitors and there is no lag from my mouse and keyboard to my laptop. I really like how it also charges your laptop so I don't have to use another port for it. What I do wish they changed about this is the length of the included usb-c cable. It's a really nice cable that you can switch between USB-c and usb-depending on what you need but because it's so short I have to have my laptop really close to my monitor. It also means that the wire does not reach to my desktop on the ground. But overall I am pretty happy with the product and it has been a great addition to my everyday life.\",\n",
       "    \"This thing is so much larger than I thought it would be, its really heavy and takes up a lot of space. I'm working on a small desk and barely have my monitors and laptop on it, this size was unexpected. While I didn’t necessarily need anything this powerful it does a good job. Setting it up is incredibly simple but you can also locate the drivers online easily if you need. I currently use a usb-c laptop and I just recently got a 4k gaming monitor and using it with this docking station compared to my older small one is like night and day, in a good way. This docking station is a good one but unless you’ve got the need for something like this, an everyday cheaper docking station will work just fine.\",\n",
       "    'This is a pretty cool “dock” to add to your laptop. It’s not small, but that’s OK. You probably won’t pack this for the road, but it is a nice way to turn a laptop into a true workstation.One thing to be aware of though is that most laptops don’t have the video chops to run dual 4K monitors. So even though this dock will support that, it can’t make your laptop do what it can’t actually do. Of course, you don’t have to hook up 4K monitors and it is quite likely your laptop would support dual HD monitors and this works great for that..',\n",

       "    'The top thing I like about this port station is the simple setup. The second is how well it charges. There are also many extra features that you don’t normally get in ports, like display port and audio port. It is very efficient. Great lifetime support from their technology team. It’s a good size. I only question the long term durability. I haven’t had it long and don’t know if it’ll last for years. It will fit nicely into a Christmas stocking though.',\n",

       "    \"This is a really nice dock as long as you are expecting the inherent flaws in the tech itself.This dock has been great for running in my dual monitor setup and leaving my keyboard and mouse attached along with a few other devices.It is important to know that this is essentially a USB graphics card and it does NOT pass through your internal graphics cards performance.That means if you have a discrete graphics card, it will not use it.There are some ways around this. But you would likely have to make sure you have at least one monitor plugged into your discrete graphics card in order to use the power of your graphics card.Once in a while one of my monitors will flash black but seems to come back on it's own without issue. Not really sure if anything can be done to fix this.While this will charge some devices, my device is not capable of receiving power from USB C but appears to function fine other than that.So far I have had no issues with audio through this device. Everything sounds great and the mic input also seems to work flawlessly as well.Overall this is a great dock/hub and I would recommend it.\",\n",

       "   'content': ['Update to review below: I’ve reduced my rating to a single star. Why? I’ve now found that running devices through this docking station significantly reduces performance and often leads to significant lag. The docking station acts as a bottle neck to internet speed and the output of connected devices. It’s a fairly costly device, and I would not recommend it...Also disappointing customer service to address the foregoing issues. ThanksPrior review: Used as a docking station for business computer. Still analyzing the unit, but immediately noticed that running an Ethernet cable through the dock  (vs directly into the computer) drastically reduces internet download speed, and using the dock makes night light feature in Win 10 pro unusable.',\n",
       "    'After it became clear that this pandemic wasn\\'t going away any time soon, and I would be working from home for at least the foreseeable future, I decided I needed a better setup than just plugging a monitor into my laptop. I decided to try to duplicate as closely as possible the setup I have at my office. I spent a bunch of time and energy researching docking stations and finally settled on this one for a handful of reasons:1) the HP docking station I have at the office is ridiculously expensive and i didn\\'t want to spend that much money;2) I wanted a docking station that would charge the laptop without a separate power cord plugged into either the dock or the laptop;3) it has 4 USB 3.0 ports instead of the usual 2, plus two USB-C ports;4) it supports dual HDMI monitors, plus dual 4K monitors if I decide to upgrade later; and5) it was featured on PC Magazine\\'s best Windows 10 laptop docks for 2020.I\\'ve been using it for a few days now and it\\'s been working great. Can\\'t find much at all to complain about. The negative reviews I\\'ve seen have mostly been compatibility with Macs, and I can\\'t speak to that, but it works perfectly well with the three Windows 10 laptops I have: an HP Elitebook, a Lenovo Ideapad; and a Huawei Matebook, it also works great with my kids\\' Chromebook. All installed the docking station without drama, and dock seamlessly when plugged in. The only issue I\\'ve seen is that the Huawei laptop doesn\\'t support Thunderbolt, so I do get a notification every time I plug it in that the device isn\\'t \"fully supported\" but it works just fine otherwise. 60w charging is more than adequate on all three machines.To address another negative review I saw-- I\\'ve noticed absolutely no decrease in internet download speeds, nor have I noticed any lag. My wireless keyboard and mouse work perfectly as well, with no obvious signal delay. I\\'m using this strictly for business applications, and the occasional web browsing. I cannot speak to how this may or may not affect gaming. The only possible complaint I might have is that the docking station I have at the office has a button to \"wake up\" the laptop from sleep mode without having to open the lid. This does not have one. It\\'s only a minor inconvenience when you first plug in a sleeping laptop. If you have your power settings to stay on with the lid closed while plugged in, as long as you remain docked, it\\'s not a problem. Occasionally bothersome, but not enough to dock any stars.Overall, I\\'m very happy with my purchase. I can\\'t think of anything I need this to do that it doesn\\'t do. Yeah it\\'s not the cheapest option out there, but I couldn\\'t find a cheaper one that did everything I wanted it to do. Good buy.',\n",

I don't notice it over-charging my MBP or anything terrible like that and it will also charge a number of other devices.  I have a FHD external webcam connected as well and there are no latency issues.The only real gripe that I have is that this requires the screen recording feature to be on at all times.  Fortunately, the MBP doesn't struggle with processing, but I imagine it's a little bit more work for the CPU.  I also only notice that 125MB of RAM, but the CPU is typically in the 15% range.  So, that's quite significant.  Also, since screen recording is being used, I can not use my Apple Watch to unlock the computer.  It's a minor inconvenience but it's also the complete loss of a feature.All in all, it's good for the money, but I think I'm going to spend a little bit more and get an eGPU for the displays.  For another couple hundred, I can also have dedicated graphics, it seems like a no brainer.\",\n",

       "   'content': ['With the Covid situation going on, I am working from home and I needed a docking station for configuring a dual display set up. I had a startech docking station in office and The office desktop support folks recommended startech for my personal macbooks.I got a loaner from office but it had a TB3 cable and didn’t support my MacBooks. I have a 2017 MacBook with USB C and a 2015 MacBook Pro with USB A. I needed a docking station that could support both.On a whim, I started a chat with the tech support on the startech website. The guy was very knowledgeable and really patient in answering my questions and recommended this docking station instead of buying a bunch of adapters.Although @ $300 this is on the high end and pricy, I decide to give it a try. I configured all peripherals and downloaded the displaylink beta 0.5 version(latest) for OSX 10.15.4.The display works like a charm. Although I am having some problems with the sleep(clamshell) mode of Mac( my laptop locks after a few second after I shut the screen and upon unlocking it, again locks it after a few seconds. The right configuration is done in the energy saver ) I don’t have any complains about the docking station so far.It does support both the 2015 and 2017 MacBooks.Also I have tested it with a windows laptop with TB3 port and it works fine.PS: I will post an update, when I figure out the issue with the laptop locking down.This does seem like a great universal docking station.',\n",

       "    '\"Universal\" anything usually isn\\'t, but this docking station truly lives up to its name. It works equally well with my work laptop (Microsoft Surface Laptop), home laptop (HP Spectre) and my MacBook Pro.

You can save a few bucks and go with another brand, but of you want a true plug-and-play docking station spend the money and buy this one.',\n",
       "    'I did get on the website and download/install the drivers. Nope. Nothing worked. Some people who wrote reviews said that \"tech support was great\". Well OK, but when I spend this much money, I expect it to work out of the box and it didn\\'t. None of the ports worked - not even the USB ! This item is on it\\'s way back (I returned it).',\n",
       "    'It works perfectly!',\n",
       "    \"I'll take you through my experience before getting into the nitty gritty specs. For this review, I grabbed my Dell Inspiron gaming laptop with thunderbolt port to test it out. It has a 7700HQ cpu so it should have new enough standards to do a good review on. I plugged in my keyboard and mouse, ethernet, and both my 4K monitors(both displayport). First, it took a minute or so for the displays or the laptop to even realize that they could communicate. The keyboard and mouse worked immediately and the displays did eventually figure out what was going on and turn on. Then I also got a pop-up saying that the cable I plugged in does not support charging. I suspect this is because the laptop knows it can pull more than the type c cable can supply, with it being a gaming laptop with a 1060, so the function is blocked by Dell. No problem. Now, lag. Definitely lag. I discovered that the thunderbolt port is not connected to the dedicated graphics card, meaning my cpu was hammering itself to supply dual 4K outputs and the included laptop display. So, no need to test it for gaming. Along with that is the inconsistency in performance on screen. It just doesn't feel smooth, and there's a little delay to it. I feel that that was from the cpu getting hit by everything I did, and the fact that the igpu has to pre-render the display and send that info over a usb connection. The ethernet on the hub did great, and was giving me the same latency as the onboard connection, and I had no issues with the mouse and keyboard.This hub does have a lot of features:2x USB 3.0 Type A ports1x Type C Gen 1 connection to laptop (Max 60W power delivery to laptop)1x RJ-45 Ethernet2x Displayport 1.2 ports2x HDMI 2.0 Ports(Only 2 of the 4 display outputs can be used at a time)Powered by an external power brick to AC power1x USB Type A charging port (Front)1x USB Type C charging port (Front)Comes with AC power adapter and Type C to Type C cable to plug into laptopBuild Quality:Build was pretty solid. It felt heavy and I have confidence that it will last. Definitely a strong side for this product. Ports felt nice and tight and captive connectors clicked in. The power cable, I think, is overkill. This thing looks nearly as thick as the power cable I got with my 850W power supply for my desktop.Use Case:So, who is this product actually for? Most likely Notebook users with macbooks or notebooks that just don't have other connections. I could see how having a station set up for a notebook with this would be hugely beneficial. Having full displays, keyboard and mouse, and an ethernet cable that might not be on the notebook at all bundled into a single package is pretty convenient. I know it's a hassle to hook up my gaming laptop when I have to take it somewhere and bring it back.Price:Here's the kicker. This thing is so expensive for what it is. At the time I'm placing this I believe it was $230. I have seen other Type C hubs for $100 that can do (almost) everything this one can do. Also, this hub is Gen 1, not Gen 2. The only real factor that could increase the value of this product over others is having all the display outputs. Looking at cheaper options I typically only see a single display output, or just a displayport and hdmi combo. If you NEED this feature, yes this could end up being what you need. And you will be paying to have it. For most users, I would say to shop for hubs around the $100 mark.\",\n",
       "    'My husband makes a living by trading and is also electronics snob and we are both passionate gamers so reliable internet and 4K monitors are a must. We set up his computer and 4 K monitors and here is what I can share:This docking station is a very powerful workstation and if you don’t need all of its features it’s going to be overkill and clearly waste of your money. However, if you DO need/want to connect 2 - 4K monitors, ability to charge your laptop and all of your peripherals with just one single cable being plugged into power outlet and everything else into this docking station that this is it. You can also lock it up so nobody is messing with your stuff.Here is the inventory and all that this monster docking station can supportFront :USB-A Charge Port - USB 3.1 Gen 1 transmits POWER OR DATA and you can charge a mobile device (7.5W)USB-C Charge Port - USB 3.1 Gen 1 transmits POWER OR DATA and you can charge a mobile device.

If you are serious about your internet connection you already know importance of wired internet AKA Wifi sucksUSB-A Peripheral Ports - USB 3.1 Gen 1 – you can connect your mouse or a keyboard.As you can tell from the above there is a good reason to call it a monster docking station. Coming from a StarTech, trusted brand and pioneer in the field, 3 yr warranty and most importantly, considering everything it can do I can justify the price tag. I don’t appreciate overpriced products but I searched the market for a product that offers all these features and I wasn’t very successful finding anything much more affordable.',\n",
       "    'Like most people I have had both the desktop computer set up that I use at home and a laptop that I use while on the go. I was tired of losing files on one and not being able to transfer them when I need them to the other, or starting projects on one and having to restart them on another. I word this docking station after my desktop computer finally died. I recently upgraded to a MacBook, and decided this would be enough computing power for all of my needs. This doc you station was the perfect solution for me. While I travel watch for work and I enjoy the slick small style my laptop, While at home I enjoy working on my two large HDMI monitors. I also enjoyed being able to use the keyboard and mouse as well as several other USB devices. The Stockton station has transformed my laptop into two computers. I can work seamlessly on projects at home and on the go. The resolution on both monitors from my laptop has been tremendous clearly 4K HD quality. Everything connects with ease and a simple plug and play.I’ve had no problems with lag or any delay from the laptop is running at once. Very happy with this decision.',\n",
       "    \"I want to be upfront with this review.  I do not own a 4K monitor.  I cannot comment on how this unit performs with one, never mind two, but I did notice something that might impact that.I ordered this unit to serve as hub for my laptop.  I wanted to be able to easily and quickly transition it to a full work station.  This unit works very well in that regard.Here is what I was look for:Q - Will it switch you from wifi to hardwired?A - Yes.Q - Will it allow you to shut your laptop and use it like a desktop?A - Yes, you have to play with your display settings, but it can do this.Q - Can I run dual monitors?A - No problem at all.  You get two HDMI and two Display Ports.Q - Will this charge my phone?A - Yes.  Most of the plugs will work for that.Q - Can I hook up a keyboard and mouse?A - Very easily.  Just use any of the USB ports.Q - Can you secure this unit?A - Yes.  There are multiple security options to lock this down if you are in a non-private work area.Other things to point out:1 - you get two plugs.  One regular and one that looks like it's designed for a high draw outlet, like an oven.  Could be an OS format.2 - This thing is solid with a bottom that girps.3 - Before using this unit, I would strongly recommend you go to the StarTechs website and download the driver.  It tells you right in the instructions to do that.  I did it upfront since hardware like this can drive you insane if you are not running it with a good driver.4 - For the people running this for two 4K or a single 5K monitor - I noticed that windows could not detect the resolution when using an HDMI.  I don't have a display port, so that might be the problem right there.  I just wanted to mention that in case it is an issue.Is this worth it?Maybe.  At this price point it's really hard to recommend for anyone not using 4K monitors.  I gave it four stars because it's well built and does what I want it too, but I bet I could get the same results with a much cheaper unit.  At least this is future proof for me. I do hope to get a good 4K or 5K cinema display for my office.  When I do, I'll make sure to update this review with my experience with that.\",\n",
       "    'This dock is pretty useful to have considering a lot of PC such as the mac and such are switching to type C plugs. What is nice about this is that you are able to use the adapter provided to plug into a type A. Be aware that type A seems to be a hit or miss if it provides a stable video connection to two screens. This particular device comes with nice type C cable which unfortunately is not a very long type c cable. What is nice about this cable is that it has an attached type C to type A adapter so you do not have to worry about losing it. The cable length however means it has to be really a bit close to your laptop. Although you can use this with a desktop this is ideally to allow your laptop to able to connect to multiple monitors plus you can easily put it directly under your monitor. This does require external power to allow for the device to work however if you device uses type C to charge this will also charge your device while plugged in. First thing right off the bat, is that this product can be used to power on your device from what I can tell however this may vary based on laptop model. It has two 3.0 usb ports on the back for fast transfer, two type C, and one 3.1 in the front for fast charging and easy access to data transfers. The device does have a power light indicator to show if the device is powered on. It is not too bright where it is a bother but it really is the only way to show if the device is actually on. The type c cable can be changed out for another and replaced easily if you happen to need a new or longer cable. The type C does also do charging if you require. The devices only has either type c, HDMI, or display for video output which is quite annoying. I would prefer display port but that is okay. The video quality is great. It really keeps video quality standard. It does get a bit warm when it is in use. Another thing I would say about this device is that it provides you additional usb 3.0 slots which allows you plug in several different devices as well as maintain a good speed of transfer. The device is actually a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The dock is fairly small and is a fairly light. It is very easy to plug into and the design is very simple. It does have a sleep mode so when it is not in use it will shut off and also the power button is not too sensitive but does not require to be pushed down too hard. The outer metal is a bit easy to scratch and notice so be careful. Overall I think this station is great if you require a dual monitor setup and additional USB ports especially with laptops that only have type c now.',\n",
       "    'Note: If you are using Windows, Linux, or MacOS with this product, I would recommend you to go to the manufacturer\\'s website and download the driver there in advance.  This will save you a lot of headaches with configuration.Startech always makes outstanding quality-of-life additions to computers, and this is no exception.  For most ultrabooks, they tend to be port deprived in exchange for portability.  This docking station is there to restore that functionality when portability is not needed as much as features.  Using one USB-C connection, you get access to multiple USB-A, a 3.5\" Aux, and HDMI and DisplayPorts to use that you may not have had with your original configuration.  There is a security lock as well if you want to tie this down, although you will end up having to buy a separate bracket if you want to mount this.There are two software enhancements with the driver installation.  You can do Power-Over-Lan and also remote security access into your laptop through the dock if you have the driver installed, enabled, and your laptop is connected.  This is a very heavy product, and it is not as portable as I would expect with these devices, but on the other hand, the functionality is pretty much unparalleled.',\n",
       "    \"My husband’s job entails computers and other forms of electronics. I know when I see computer items that I need to ask if it’s something he could use. This one was something he was very excited about. After recently upgrading to a high-end laptop, he wanted this docking station specifically for the dual 4k monitor support in his home office. It effectively makes his laptop into a desktop workstation and being able to power and charge it through the Thunderbolt port lets him leave his power brick plugged in by his recliner. It worked right out of the box with Windows 10 and didn't require any drivers. The Ethernet jack stays plugged into the gigabit switch that his file server sits on and makes backups fast and easy. He also leaves his dedicated headphones plugged into the audio jack so he can just sit down and put them on, and the USB-C charging port on the front powers his wireless charging pad. Having both HDMI and DisplayPort outputs for each monitor is a bonus because he really likes the versatility. He loves this, and we highly recommend it!\",\n",
       "    \"Currently, I'm using this for the laptop that I need for work. Overall since I got everything working I have been happy with it. I can come home hook up the one cable and have everything up and running in seconds. I have not noticed any drop in quality to my monitors and there is no lag from my mouse and keyboard to my laptop. I really like how it also charges your laptop so I don't have to use another port for it. What I do wish they changed about this is the length of the included usb-c cable. It's a really nice cable that you can switch between USB-c and usb-depending on what you need but because it's so short I have to have my laptop really close to my monitor. It also means that the wire does not reach to my desktop on the ground. But overall I am pretty happy with the product and it has been a great addition to my everyday life.\",\n",
       "    \"This thing is so much larger than I thought it would be, its really heavy and takes up a lot of space. I'm working on a small desk and barely have my monitors and laptop on it, this size was unexpected. While I didn’t necessarily need anything this powerful it does a good job. Setting it up is incredibly simple but you can also locate the drivers online easily if you need. I currently use a usb-c laptop and I just recently got a 4k gaming monitor and using it with this docking station compared to my older small one is like night and day, in a good way. This docking station is a good one but unless you’ve got the need for something like this, an everyday cheaper docking station will work just fine.\",\n",
       "    'This is a pretty cool “dock” to add to your laptop. It’s not small, but that’s OK. You probably won’t pack this for the road, but it is a nice way to turn a laptop into a true workstation.One thing to be aware of though is that most laptops don’t have the video chops to run dual 4K monitors. So even though this dock will support that, it can’t make your laptop do what it can’t actually do. Of course, you don’t have to hook up 4K monitors and it is quite likely your laptop would support dual HD monitors and this works great for that..',\n",

There are also many extra features that you don’t normally get in ports, like display port and audio port. It is very efficient. Great lifetime support from their technology team. It’s a good size. I only question the long term durability. I haven’t had it long and don’t know if it’ll last for years. It will fit nicely into a Christmas stocking though.',\n",

But you would likely have to make sure you have at least one monitor plugged into your discrete graphics card in order to use the power of your graphics card.Once in a while one of my monitors will flash black but seems to come back on it's own without issue. Not really sure if anything can be done to fix this.While this will charge some devices, my device is not capable of receiving power from USB C but appears to function fine other than that.So far I have had no issues with audio through this device. Everything sounds great and the mic input also seems to work flawlessly as well.Overall this is a great dock/hub and I would recommend it.\",\n",

       "   'content': [\"After my Plugable docking station crashes my brand new laptop multiple times while trying to wake it up, I thought it was best to try something different.  The Plugable used to take between 5 to 10 seconds to wake up the computer and all the monitors with a Windows sound for each device that is connected, but this one takes up to 2 seconds.  It makes only one sound to wake up the computer and all the devices are automatically available.  This one is about 75% faster than the plugable and my internet speed is about 40% faster than it used to be with the Plugable.I doubted it because there's no DVI and VGA ports on this one, but I'm still able to connect 5 monitors on this one like on the Plugable and now waiting to receive a USB 3 to VGA adapter to connect an additional monitor.Like all universal docking station, this one doesn't charge your laptop, so you have to plug it on the power outlet.I wish there was a way to connect both my work laptop and my personal laptop at the same time so with just a push of a button to switch between laptop.  Right now I always have to unplug one laptop to connect the other one.  It looks like no docking station can do that yet.One problem I found so far is that I cannot use DP and HDMI at the same time.  If I connect to a DP, I lose the screens that are connected to the HDMI.  That's not a big deal for me because I have the option to connect only to HDMI.Only 2 monitors are able to display the resolution 2560 x 1440 and any additional monitor would display 1920 x 1080.\",\n",
       "    'The best docking station I have ever used. Works seamlessly for my work laptop and my 27\" monitors. With HDMI and DP outputs and enough USBs to handle all of the peripherals. I connected this with a peripheral switch as well to switch between Desktop and my work laptop.All the other docks out there seem to provide only one or one with an HDMI that you have to end up buying another dongle/adapter to make it work. I don\\'t know of anyone who has one of each monitor, so having one of each seems a bit odd. If you are going for dual monitors, usually you have one or the other, and Wavlink got it right.They also got it right when it comes to setup and installation. I am using Windows 10 and I literally plugged it in to my computer and watched the device drivers get added automatically. I had to do absolutely zero configuration and installation steps, it just worked out of the box plug-n-play! I know there were updated drivers on the Displaylink site, but I didn\\'t have to do it...everything just worked!As for the displays, it actually seems like they became brighter and more clear than they were before. I have 2 DP displays running at 1900 x 1200 and the laptop running as well. The text was clear and I could not make the screen flicker or show glitches no matter how much movement I did on the screen, load down the Gbps Ethernet, or try to overload the dock. It all worked flawlessly.',\n",
       "    'I should have bought it long ago, but I wasn\\'t sure about if they could deliver or not.My laptop has a 4 k screen and I do have another screen dell 4 k 60 hz 27 \", 3 Hdd, mouse wacom tablet, and I do connect my camera in order to download images to my hdd. Before I have had all the outlets of my laptop occupied and I was disconnecting things in order to connect another device since laptop never have enough usb\\'s  , not anymore.This device in particular has 6 usb 3, it does not charge your laptop via thunderbolt but there are no need, and the model who does, it does not have 6 usb 3 but 4, and 2 usb 2, so I chose to have as much as possible usb 3\\'s .I was very close to send it back since the 2nd screen dell 27\" 4k 60 hz was going black when playing youtube 4k or netflix, but I plugged an Display Port 1.2 instead of the hdmi and voila!!, no problem at all, so I would recommend you choose carefully the cable you will use with this apparatus. I do not do video gaming, maybe if you do, take a Display Port 1.4?,...just in case?Hope this review will help you choose well.Have a nice day.',\n",
       "    \"I have to use a Mac for my day job and I'm remote. So I wanted a docking station that allowed me to use my monitor and home setup for my PC. This docking station is compatible with both!!! Most other docking stations that claim they are for both Mac/PC need to have both be USB-C/Thunderbolt and aren't compatible if you want to use the docking station with PC through USB 3. On the PC side, it's plug and play -- I literally just plugged the USB cable in and everything was working on its own. For the Mac, I had to download the driver, and once that was installed, it was plug and play as well. EASY PEASY. Display settings recognized everything for Mac.It comes with two cables (one USB 3 and the other USB-C). I use the USB 3 one consistently which also works with the USB-C to USB adapters for mac.This device came up on Amazon search as an ad, and I'm SO GLAD it did because it's the only one I've found that works like this which is exactly what I needed!!!! Plenty of ports for everything, no issues with anything. Stellar product all around!!! Highly recommended.\",\n",
       "    \"I compared model after model of USB C docking stations and this was by far my favorite - Supports 2 additional 4k or 1 5k monitor (both HDMI and DisplayPort), has separate mic and headphone jacks, 6 USB ports, and a LAN port.I bought this for my Lenovo Yoga 920 since it has far less ports than i would like for days that i would like to use my External Hard Drive, CD Drive, along with various other USB devices. So far I am very pleased and is exactly what I wanted. I have it command-stripped to my desk to keep it steady in place with my Hard drive ready to go whenever I need it!Definitely be sure to download the Display Link Driver (but not Actual Multiple Monitors unless you plan on paying for it, totally unnecessary). I couldn't figure out why the HDMI ports were not working until I downloaded the driver.Does not support charging while plugged in, but it has just about anything else you would need. Highly recommend!\",\n",
       "    \"Think twice! The docking station has lots of ports and I was able to plug in everything I needed to run my laptop and large monitor along with speakers Wi-Fi etc. Everything seemed fine then my monitor started acting up. I thought it was the monitor (it's only 2 months old). But upon taking it off the docking station and plugging directly into my laptop it worked fine. Since I have had this dock past the Amazon return window but still with in the warranty period, I contacted Wavlink (can only do so by email...they're in China) they have not responded to my requests. This is a pain as I need the use of the dock constantly. May be forced to purchase a new one now. $155 out the window.\",\n",
       "    \"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This is a nice dock if you use your laptop in more then one space. This dock allows you to hook in all your accessories into one box and then just run a USB C cable to your actual laptop. No more having to unhook a bunch of lines just to get your laptop free. If you are running dual monitors you can run them at full 4K which is great. If you are using just one monitor you can run up to 5K but in reality most people using this will be using it for dual monitors so 4K is really good for 99% of what you will be doing anyway. The unit itself is designed really well and gives you everything you need in one easy location. So far it's been a nice addition to my desk and makes moving my laptop from one area to another a breeze.\",\n",
       "    'I bought a new tablet computer for my girl, and it came with only a few ports where I decided to go one level above a hub and picked up this docking station with really good specs.  Out of the box, this is a solid piece of equipment. All the ports are high grade, no cheap breakable types, but solid high end ports that either snap in, or fit snug where not a single plug is loose.  The power cable plugs in well too with plenty of wire to go a long ways to my outlet. And I do love a snug plugin like this one, where the adapter plug is solid, and never loose. The USB ports allow solid throughput where I put my portal disc on one, and it ran with it. Synced perfectly to the speed of the tablets drives.  The video ports are high grade as well. Due to the ports being 4k, there is a Windows 10 driver to download from their website, which downloaded fast, loaded quickly with no complicated install questions, and worked great, once I did a reboot of the computer.  The ethernet throughput is also impressive, where I compared the tablet WIFI and then plugged a cable into the docking station and wow, what a difference in speed.  The docking station works perfectly, highly recommend this one, where I am very happy with the purchase.',\n",

Easy and quick to juggle between two machines and you have instant dual monitors between the two machines once the usb-c is connected from one laptop to another.  From what I see on the market, most laptops have the usb-c port, but double check with your laptop to make sure it has this before you buy this product (it probably does).Really easy set up and works great.

Occasionally, one or both of the displays 'reset' by going black and then restoring display.  Was also disappointed initially with the lack of ability to power to the MBP through the dock.  I eventually switched to plugging the 2 monitors directly to MBP using HDMI->USB-C adapters, and only used the dock for internet and basic USB connections.Eventually, the OSX upgrade to 10.13 broke the DisplayLink drivers, so I was stuck with just one 4K monitor for a few months, until last month when Display Link released v5.0 of their drivers and I upgraded to macOS Mojave 10.14.  At that point I decided to give the dock another shot to drive the 2 4K monitors and voila, it's working.  I've been running in this configuration for a day or 2, so jury is still out on how stable it will be, but will keep you posted.\",\n",

I was able to download and install the drivers from the Wavlink website (which then caused my Mac to freeze up forcing a reboot).  Once rebooted, the two external monitors as well as my Mac's monitor all displayed the same screen.  It took a while to figure out how to trick the dock and Mac into displaying seperate side-by-side monitors.  Still one of the monitors displayed what was on my Mac's screen and there was no way to change that.  Okay, fine I  will close the Mac's lid anyway.  But the external monitors kept flashing on and off and losing their layout configuration.  Flash, monitors blank.  Flash, monitors back on but showing the same screen.  Back to Display setting, reconfigure side-by-side monitors.  Works for a minute.  Then flash, monitors blank, flash monitors on showing the same screen again.

       "    \"With 15+ years of experience working in IT, I'm no stranger to laptop docks, and frankly have rarely given them much thought.  You plug them in, and they just work.  However, with this one, I'm seeing a very strange behavior in that my external monitors exhibit a subtle flicker when connected to this dock.  They are perfectly stable and have no issues if I connect one directly to the HDMI out on my laptop, or when I test them on an alternate computer... however, bizarrely, when I type on my usb keyboard (also connected to this dock), the image on my external monitor flickers just enough to catch my eye and be distracting.  I have already downloaded the latest display link drivers, and have not seen any improvement.  I'll keep looking for a solution, but if I can't find one soon, I may be forced to return this one and look for another brand.Update:  I ended up being forced to return this dock.  I began experiencing recurring issues where my external monitors connected through this dock would lose connection for a very brief moment.  Which for me, was a big problem, because it happened during important meetings where I was sharing content from my external screen via Zoom.  When it lost connection for that moment, it crowded all of my content over to my main laptop screen and messed up the screen share.  I had to scramble to bring the content to the top of the mess, and start sharing again, which was not a smooth process.  Thinking that it was just too much for the dock to push two 4k displays, I tested it with only 1 external 4k monitor connected, but it had the same issues.  Perhaps it would work for a 1080p monitor or two, but it definitely cannot handle the 4k screens (in spite of the misleading product specifications).On a good note, I ended up solving my problem in a fantasticallly economical way... I connected 1 monitor directly to my laptop via the single HDMI port, and then I connected the other one via a $18 USB-C to Display Port adapter, and it has been rock solid!!  Sure I've got all my usb devices plugged into my laptop instead of a tidy dock, but functionality outweighs cosmetics any day.\",\n",

Catalina botched their drivers, leaving two options: (1) an updated driver without 90 degree rotation installed (“coming ‘soon’”) which is a complete non-starter for me as I need a rotated monitor for coding and documents, and (2) the older kernel extension driver which is supposed to support rotation, but which takes several hoops to get working in order to defeat post-Mojave security, and indeed, I never did (going so far as adding the developer to the trusted developer hashes manually in recovery mode after the system preferences pane failed to provide me with the prompt; the driver kernel extension then loaded successfully but the screen remained blank).So I can use this as a glorified USB hub until they get around to rotating.

In particular, I've experienced the following:- The dock caused my laptop to hang by using 100% of the laptop's CPU. I had to turn off the dock, then turn it back on, for the dock to behave normally again and stop hogging the CPU cycles.- Something about the USB communications is odd because my laptop often immediately wakes up after it's been put to sleep (despite being careful not to touch the keyboard/mouse connected to the dock). The laptop will also often randomly wake up quite often if the dock is not turned off. Turning off the dock while the laptop is sleeping resolves the issue.Fortunately the 100% CPU issue is quite rare but the wake-from-sleep issue happens all the time in the few months I've been using this dock.\",\n",

Security Privacy settings you have to let the software have access to Screen record - but it then works on all displays.  The Plugable Docking station seems high quality and all ports work.  The only downer is you can't charge with this docking station, but not a big deal - you can use the 2nd Thunderbolt port to charge the laptop.  I've used up almost all ports and the Ethernet port is legit - 950 Mbps download no issues on 1 Gig service.  I'd love to see a docking station with this price range that also charges.  But alas you have to pay $100 more for that.  Anyways, nice job Plugable. Well done.\",\n",

I have had at least 20 trouble free calls by now. Both my QHD monitors are displaying full resolution as well.

       "    \"I've used a number of docking stations for years now and it's been nice to see how they have evolved.While there is much to like here there is one shortcoming as well.The ability to have multiple monitors on a system like a laptop while adding more USB ports and a second network connection makes laptops a lot more flexible. It also offers the ability when packing up to basically unplug one cable form a laptop plus the power cable and that's it, ready to go into the bag.For people who can run a computer but are lost when it comes to more technical aspects, such as driver and hardware installation, this is an easy peezy device to use. There was no driver installation or configuration required. Just plug in the cables at both ends and plug in the power supply. Windows, both 8.1 and 10, took care of every else.The shortcoming:When using the HDMI connections I find that the read and write USB speed is consistent with USB 3. I could have used the display ports but if you read the manual these ports hog bandwidth which limits using the USB ports bandwidth so read and write speeds sloooow down. To run 4K on two monitors a lot of bandwidth is needed, plain and simple even with the built-in graphics capabilities. Running both display port connections the USB read and write speeds are greatly reduced as is the throughput on the docks network connection. Because of this I used the two HDMI connections.► The kit includes two USB adapter cables, one Type-A to Type-B, and one Type-C to Type-B. Type-B being the connector used on the dock. This allows the dock to be used with both old and newer machines. Even though there is a Type-C adapter cable included the dock runs at a maximum bandwidth throughput of USB 3, not 3.1. If you need more bandwidth because you have a lot of connections that are active, both USB and monitors, at the same time you'll want to look at a dock that has at least a minimum of 5GBPS bandwidth, even better but more expensive are docks which have a 10GBPS bandwidth capability. The bandwidth issue is not unique to the Plugable line of docking stations.► There haven't been any issues when running two monitors off of the dock. The video is clean (no noise) and I appreciate that they will run at 60Hz. Would be nicer to have 144Hz but still better than many of the alternatives.Where's the USB C connector:One thing that's missing is a USB C connection on the dock itself. With all the OTG devices that are available these days, it would be nice if there was a C port located on the front so that these devices could be plugged into the dock. Sure the speed would be greatly reduced but at least I could plug these devices into the dock. Since the laptop only has one USB C port and the dock is plugged into that I need to use another adapter to go from Type-A to Type-C female...!Overall, the cost for what you get makes this an expensive option but it will enable most people to expand the connections they have on an older laptop or PC. For about $20 more there are options here on Amazon that will give you full 10GBPS bandwidth with the same connections for monitors plus they have USB C ports on the front, look up WAVELINK and Cable Matters.\",\n",
       "    'I\\'ve tested two \"Pluggable!\" brand dock/port-replicators now, the other being about 25% less expensive on account of deleting the 4K DisplayPort support. They\\'re otherwise identical and my review will be similarly glowing.Work from home is the new norm and the longer this goes on, the more devices I find myself adding to my home office to make work more efficient. As such, I either run out of ports on the laptop, or at least run out of CONVENIENT ones.I\\'ve tested this with three laptops, an older ASUS ultrabook, and a newer HP Pavilion and a higher-end production laptop running Adobe Creative Suite and a variety of production software.The majority of my devices (keyboard, mouse, scanner, label-printer, external USB microphone) stay permanently connected to the rear USB-ports, leaving the front ports for commonly swapped items like digital camera, USB sticks, card readers, and smartphones.What this dock adds over the entry level model is DisplayPort connectors (in addition to HDMI) and an on-board graphics processor that effectively drives 4k screens. For basic 4K use (Photoshop, Illustrator), it works great. It is NOT however geared to graphic heavy-lifting like full-screen 4k video - you\\'re going to run into a bottleneck there and would either want a desktop system, or connecting directly to your production laptop\\'s display-port.Another note: none of Pluggable\\'s docks support High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP). If you have copy-protected media, every device in the chain has to support HDCP so you can\\'t play that content on a monitor connected through this dock.The only other con (if you can call it that) is the lack of USB-C Power Delivery (PD) pass through.Nearly top marks - if you\\'re OK with the limitations and just want a 4K display-port cable USB port replicator, this is a fine device.',\n",

It saves a lot of time and effort and makes everything look much more clean and organized.It features a total of 10 ports: 2 HDMI Display Ports (connect two 4K displays), 6 USB 3.0 (perfect for a mouse, keyboard, thumb drive, external hard drive, etc.), 1 Combination Audio Jack (to listen to music, connect external speakers or even a headset with a microphone) and also 1 Ethernet port. Most of my devices that I use regularly (mouse, keyboard, printer, external hard drive, etc.) stay connected to the rear ports which keeps the front ports free for less permanent items like USB Sticks, cameras, headsets, and so on. I have an extra monitor connected to this device and I love that the HDMI resolution is nice and clear.The only thing it doesn’t do is charge your computer so you will still need a separate charger for your laptop or tablet.

I'd like to have more USB's on the front rather than having to pull the hub forward for things that are not always plugged in to avoid disturbing the cables that are already arranged.My biggest disappointment is there are no USB-C ports.  My preferred ear buds use USB-C and this is an increasingly common connector so to me this is an oversight.The hub could also benefit from a heavier base.

With this versatile docking station I don't need to plug and unplug the many cables going from the laptop to the monitors, keyboards, mouse, speakers and the modem. Thanks to this unit all I do is plug and unplug a single cable, plus the laptop's own power supply if needed.  In addition, with many laptops getting lighter and thinner, they are loosing many of the different display port options found in previous, larger laptops. These docking stations effectively resolve that issue.This is a vertical docking station, with a reasonably stable stand. It kind of resembles many modems, but it's loaded with useful ports, including a whopping 6 USB 3.0 ports, an Ethernet port for those who prefer a faster wired connection, two display and HDMI ports, a host port, as well as an AUX port. All those ports are thoughtfully spaced apart so it's easy to plug everything in. The package also comes with a USB 3.0 and a USB-C cables. It does not include HDMI cables.The docking station will almost exclusively be used for work purposes. It's not ideal for gaming nor watching Netflix. But for productivity, it works flawlessly on both of my 4K monitors, and is able to fully take advantage of their 60hz refresh rate, with no visible lagging or blur. I also love the audio port which many third party docking stations miss. The station works quietly and runs cool, which is also a good thing when it comes to longevity. The only thing to dislike about this unit are the short cables that they included, especially if the laptop is a little farther from the docking station.

The back of the unit includes an additional four USB 3.0 ports, an ethernet port, two HDMI outputs, two Displayport outputs, a power port, and the port to connect the included cable to your laptop.Drivers are needed to take full advantage of this dock, and a URL is included in the instructions (no CD or USB drive is included).While this dock offers some advantages over plugging your laptop into a monitor. Obviously, being able to use dual monitors is a huge advantage with this dock, but the added expandability via the included USB ports also enhances your ability to connect more devices than most laptops would usually be able to accommodate.This specific dock allows for 4k output, and I highly recommend it over the 1080p model because it offers USB 3.0 ports (instead of 2.0), and the Displayport outputs allow for greater compatibility.It's important to note that there are some limitations when using this dock, and they could be dealbreakers for some.First, it's not designed for gaming. You will have poor performance and it's not recommended. It also will not play protected content, so some streaming services like Netflix may not be able to play. When connecting this hub to my Android phone (yes, it can be done!), trying to play movies from the Netflix app produced a black video.If you're using this for office and productivity, then it's a power tool.\",\n",

This works perfectly for productivity and even webcam sessions but would be ill advised for slacking / playing a game because DisplayLink just doesn\\'t work smoothly enough for that.I don\\'t have dual 4K at home but this does work well with dual 2K screens. The 2K screens are gaming monitors that don\\'t get up to their full refresh rate but that\\'s to be expected.The two pluggable USB docking stations I used were both incredibly reliable. Despite running through huge datasets over ethernet and being connected to two fairly high res displays, this has been incredibly stable and reliable.One good thing is that Displaylink is quite well recognized and almost all large corporations provide drivers in  the self-serve stores so you likely won\\'t even need to bug IT.',\n",
       "    'If you’ve purchased a laptop or a notebook in the past few years, you’ve probably noticed that a major trend is the removal of more and more ports in order to make laptops smaller, thinner and more portable. I personally love the feel of a sleek, thin laptop that weighs next to nothing, but when you suddenly need multiple USB, HDMI and display ports, you realize that there’s a downside to that kind of design. This laptop docking station is the answer to that problem: you set it up at home, connect your laptop to it, and now you have ports of all shapes and sizes you can access. When you’re on the go you unplug your computer and leave the docking station at home. Your laptop can remain slim and lightweight, but you still have access to the additional ports you might want in your home office.A couple things worth noting: this docking station does NOT charge your laptop. It also is not designed with video games or even streaming videos in mind, though you can use it to connect to a large 4k or HDMI display. It is also not compatible with Mac or Linux.Overall if you use a laptop or notebook as your main PC, having access to the this many USB 3 ports and display ports is very helpful at home or while on the road.',\n",

       "   'content': ['I wanted so much to like this unit - small, well designed, great monitor resolution output and above average power delivery.Unfortunately, I\\'ve encountered two issues that make this unit difficult to use, if certainly not worth the price:1. Sound output is choppy. It cuts out at ransom intervals - sometimes every couple of minutes, sometimes every few seconds. It\\'s bad enough that listening to music is too frustrating, and any sort of online video is at times incomprehensible.2. Once or twice per day, it drops and then reconnects the monitors about four times in succession, before returning to their on state. During that time, I have about two minutes where the computer is unusable because of flashing monitors, resizing screen resolutions, and for some reason, mouse and keyboard inputs being frozen - which is indicative of this being a dock issue altogether, not just a monitor or cable connection problem.I contacted StarTech\\'s support initially over the sound output issues. We went over a number of troubleshooting steps to try and isolate the cause, and their support staff arrived at the conclusion that my dock\\'s onboard hardware was faulty. On his suggestion, I returned and replaced the defective unit via Amazon over their own warranty process. The new dock I received has the same sound output issues and after two weeks of use, developed the video output issues. StarTech.com is aware of the issues with this model, though it appears problems are not limited to single units, rather this model run as a whole. I certainly don\\'t have a unique setup (laptop connection with two 27\" monitors connected via HDMI and wireless keyboard/mouse), but this being a \"universal docking station\" is unfortunately just not what its capable of.',\n",

       "    '(Read on for an explanation of the three pairs of video out ports, what they do, and how many your computer will be able to use--The manufacturer is not clear on this point, so I will be)I have been through an amazing number of USB docks over the past year. With the move towards USB-C and Thunderbolt connections that support external video, it seems everyone and his brother has introduced a docking station.But there are HUGE differences among these docking stations. You have docking stations that only support video for Thunderbolt connections (as found in most recent Macbooks and a few recent Windows machines). You have docking stations that support both Thunderbolt and USB-C connectors that support \"alt\" mode, allowing video to pass through the USB-C connection. You have docking stations that support any USB connection. But, generally, you don\\'t have docking stations that support everything.Until now. What we have here is a docking station that supports Thunderbolt and USB-C (alt mode) video, but ALSO supports video over standard USB 3 (and higher) connectors. By doing that, it\\'s a docking station that will work with just about any laptop or computer from the past decade. There are some caveats, however.The manufacturer asserts that this docking station can support up to three external 4K monitors, and it will allow either a HDMI or Displayport connection for each of those monitors. This is true. What they are not clear about is that in order to use all three external monitors, you will need to connect it to your computer via either a Thunderbolt or USB-C (video alt mode supported) connection. If you connect the dock via a standard USB-A connection, or else a USB-C connection that does not support video alt mode, then you get a maximum of two external monitors. But, on the upside, EVERY computer supports at least two external monitors, and both monitors can be run at 4K/60Hz.This needs to be broken down a bit more. And, honestly, I\\'m, amazed the manufacturer doesn\\'t explain this more clearly on this or any website. But they don\\'t. So I will.There are three sets of video connectors on this dock. Each set consists of one HDMI port and one Displayport port. You can use EITHER one of those two choices for each of the connectors (but you can\\'t use both simultaneously). So, you can use HDMI or Displayport for Video 1. HDMI or Displayport for Video 2, etc. (See photos).What the manufacturer does not clarify, either online or in the manual is the following info about those three sets of video ports.Video 1 (see photo): This is the video pass-through coming from the cable that connects to your computer. If you have a computer that supports Thunderbolt or else USB-C with alt video mode (note that Thunderbolt and USB-C ports look the same), then that video will get passed through on the Video 1 ports. Not all USB-C ports pass through video, and if you computer does not pass video through the USB-C port you use to connect to it, then you won\\'t get video out on the Video 1 connectors. Similarly, if you use a USB-A connector (old style rectangle), that type of connection never passes video, and you won\\'t be able to use the Video 1 connectors.Video 2 and Video 3: These video outputs use the USB (or Thunderbolt) input signal and use a technology called DisplayLink. DisplayLink is a clever approach to external video. It creates a virtual video card on your host computer system. It compresses the video signal that is sent to this virtual video card (so that only differences in the information for the screen as passed). And it sends that compressed signal across the USB connection to the Displaylink decompressor chip that is contained in the dock. The dock decompresses the signal and pushes it to your external monitor. The compression step allows a lot of video information to be pushed across a 5 or 10GBps connection (USB 3/USB 3.1/USB 3.1 rev 2/etc.). The latest DisplayLink chip, the 6950, is included in this dock, and it supports up to 2 external monitors, each running at up to 4K/60Hz.The bottom line is that ANY host computer can push video to the dock and display it from the Video 2 and Video 3 ports. Up to 2 monitors at 4K/60Hz can be supported. But ONLY a Thunderbolt or USB-C (supporting alt) connection from the host computer can power that third (\"Video 1\") port. Put another way: This dock can support up to 2 monitors for older USB-A and USB-C (no alt mode) computers. It can support up to 3 monitors for Thunderbolt or USB-C (alt mode) computers. This is not discussed anywhere in the documentation, which Is pretty ridiculous. But I\\'ve described it here, and hopefully it helps you understand the limitations of this dock.Now, in terms of limitations of the three ports:Video 1: Thunderbolt will support 4K/60Hz. This video is powered by the video card in your computer, and response rates should be sufficient for any type of application, even GPU intensive gaming (provided the video card in your computer is up to the task). USB-C (alt mode) will generally support 4K/30Hz. This is a limitation of the USB-C alt mode implementation. If you want to provide both video and USB 3 connectors on the hub, you are limited to 4K/30Hz. To get to 4K/60Hz, you would need to remove the USB 3 connectors and replace them with molasses-slow USB 2 connectors--not good for a docking station.Video 2 and Video 3: These support up to 4K/60Hz. However, because they rely on DisplayLink, with compression overhead, they will not be as responsive for very high demand applications. What this means is that these external displays will be fine for workstation apps (Office, Photoshop, etc.) and for standard video apps (Netflix, Youtube, etc.). They are also fine for some video games.  But for video games that are very GPU intensive and that depend on very high frames per second, these video ports are generally not suitable. For those, you\\'ll want to use the Video 1 port.Enough of the background. How well did this work?Very well, indeed. The ports operated as they were supposed to. I tested it on both a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 (a tablet that\\'s getting a bit long in the tooth, and only has a USB 3.0 connector) and on a Google Pixelbook Go tablet running Chrome OS.I attached the dock to the Surface Pro 3, and DisplayLink drivers were automatically installed. I did go to the DisplayLink website and download the latest drivers, which were about 8 months newer, and installed those after the dock was attached. I was able to run both a 4K monitor and a 1080p monitor simultaneously off the dock (I didn\\'t have two 4K monitors to test simultaneously, but there\\'s no reason to believe it wouldn\\'t have worked). The 4K monitor installed at 4K/60Hz. This is fantastic and better than the maximum performance I can get with that tablet if I connect directly to the tablet\\'s built-in mini-Displayport connection (which maxes out at 4K/30Hz).  Performance with the 4K/60Hz monitor through the dock was fine (although displaying a 4K video on that monitor pretty much maximized the CPU and memory of the laptop--this was not a DisplayLink issue).Satisfied that that worked, I tried using the dock with a Google Pixelbook Go. The USB-C connectors on this laptop are alt-enabled--so they can push video. DisplayLink drivers are built into the ChromeOS, so no driver downloads were required. The dock attached itself quickly and correctly. I then tested the connections. Connecting to Video 1 provided video at 4K/30Hz (as expected, since two of the USB-C lanes are providing data for the USB 3 connections on the dock). Connecting to Video 2 or Video 3, provided video at 4K/60Hz (using DisplayLink technology). With two external monitors (4K, 1080p), this setup worked great. The Pixelbook also supports pass-through charging. This means that the laptop is charged via the same USB-C cable which is providing the data stream between the laptop and the docking station. This worked fine.A test of the USB 3.1 rev 2 10GBps ports verified that they were providing the speed promised.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the dock, and would claim this to be the best USB-based dock I have yet tested. My only qualm is that it\\'s relatively expensive. But, given all the features and the fact that they work as promised, I think it\\'s worth what it costs.What you get in the box:The docking station/hubA power brick for the docking station. The rated output of the power brick is 20V/7.5A, or 150W. This should be more than sufficient to provide the rated pass-through charging on ~100W.Three power cords that attach to the power brick. You will use one of these. The three  options are : US 3 prong; US 2 prong + ground wire; European.A USB cable that connects to your PC. The end that connects to the dock is USB-C (and has a couple of screw-downs to keep it in place). The end that connects to your PC offers both USC-C (/Thunderbolt) and USB-A, via an adapter.A brief instruction bookletDocking station is about 9x3\", and less than  a couple of inches high.Outputs:Video 1 (Thunderbolt/USB-C (alt mode)) pass through: HDMI OR DisplayportVideo 2 (Displaylink): HDMI OR DisplayportVideo 3 (DisplayLink) HDMI OR Displayport1 x Gigabit Ethernet1 x USB 3.1 rev 2 (10Gbps) USB-C1 x USB 3.1 rev 2 (10GBps) USB-A (data speed shared with above)3 x USB 3.1 rev 1 (5GBps) USB-A1 x USB 3.1 rev 1 (5GBps) USB-CHeadphone jackPower buttonA great docking station.

       "    'My laptop is setup on a desk next to my main rig and does \"side jobs\" like streaming, web access, and whatnot while my main desktop is busy with 3D prints and photo/video editing work.  I needed a hub that would play well with my setup and this does, beautifully.So to start out with, MOUNTING.  Here\\'s my star off, in case you\\'re wondering, \"Why not 5 stars?\"  Well, StarTech did us the service of building a mounting spot into the back of this, but then gave us NOTHING in terms of actually mounting it.  Does everyone out there really have this stuck on their desk with wires going all over?  The goal for me was to move it OFF my desk, not stick something else on there.  So when I saw it had a way to mount it, I was quite happy.  Then I found nothing else - no bracket, no screws, no instructions.  Just, \"Good luck mounting this!\"For the record, the screws that fit the back of this hub are the same screws used to hold a PC\\'s optical drive in place.  Hard drive/case screws are wrong.  If you have screws that work in to mount an optical drive, then you have screws that will thread properly into the back of this.  What I did was take 2 right-angle brackets, used one of the existing holes and drilled another hole to match the spacing in the mount on the back of this and screwed angle brackets to it.  I then secured the free ends of the brackets to the wall with drywall screws.  But I gotta tell you...it would have been a LOT EASIER had StarTech actually provided a MOUNT for something which is OBVIOUSLY MOUNTABLE (and SHOULD be).Ahem.  StarTech.Moving on.  I have ethernet, power, and USB from my laptop feeding into the hub.  The hub feeds my laptop it\\'s internet connection.  In HDMI port 3 on the hub, I have my J-tech Digital wireless HDMI transmitter plugged in streaming to my television across the room.  HDMI port 2 on the hub feeds into my 27\" display beside my laptop.  I have the display settings set to extend the desktop across all 3 (rather than mirroring the one display on all 3).  What makes this great for me is the fact it plays well with both a wired 1080p connection to my 27\" monitor and a wireless 1080p connection via my HDMI wireless transmitter.  This allows my laptop to stream uninterrupted to the TV for whoever\\'s watching as well as providing 2 screens on the desk for web access or whatever else.So for my setup and intentions, this works GREAT.  I literally couldn\\'t ask it to work any better, because what I had planned for it to do and expected it to do, it DOES.  With no arguments or gobs of time spent troubleshooting why this or that won\\'t connect or why this or that doesn\\'t work.All I did was go to the startech website, put in the model of this hub, which found the model in question (kudos for a working, functional website, Startech) and downloaded the 2 drivers that mattered (the network driver and the Displaylink driver) which I installed prior to plugging everything in.  Once I had everything connected, I had to wait about a minute (probably less) for all the \"handshakes\" to re-establish themselves for connection to the internet via USB instead of the RJ45 cable and then voila the internet worked again.  Went to the display settings to \"extend\" instead of \"mirror\" and everything worked GREAT.WOO HOO!So I really like this hub.  Most definitely.  But Startech...you have a piece of hardware that is mountable.  And which, ideally, SHOULD be mounted somewhere to get it out of the way.  Please...PLEASE...start putting mounting brackets in with these.I definitely recommend this hub.  Just understand you\\'ll have to work out your own mounting method like I did if you intend to not have it on your desktop.',\n",
       "    'We own several docking stations for different setups. My husband and I are both avid gamers, he is a trader and has a different setup for that and I have my own setup for my business. This baby right here sits on our gaming setup Throne.It’s not expensive for what it does, this is not the regular docking station. I supports 3 (THREE!) 4K monitors, that’s a big deal in a world of docking stations. Furthermore, it’s universal, works with Mac, PC, Chrome and that’s another big deal. There are many cheaper docking stations but they don’t deliver this type of performance so let’s not compare tomatoes and ketchup. Also, StarTech offers limited lifetime warranty and their customer service goes a long way.Now that the price is out of the way, let’s talk about what all it can do.Power delivery. You can charge your laptop too, not only your peripherals.  This eliminates one big cable which is one of the main purposes of a docking station. Most docking stations don’t supply power for the laptop so there is another price justification.Lock feature. Yup you can lock it up so nobody can get into your stuff.Doesn’t get hot even with three monitors running.Reasonable footprint, it’s not too large, it’s thick but not too big.Here is the inventory of all ports, I will try to sum up and briefly describe them for you:Front:USB-C Charge Port (connect a peripheral or charge the phone)USB-A Charge Port (connect a peripheral or charge the phone)Audio input/output. 3.5mm jack (Speakers or Headset)Power button - LED indicator when ONRear:DC Power Input Port - power up your docking stationUSB-C Host Port - Power Delivery to charge your laptop. Might need to use adapter depending on your machine.3 x Video DisplayPort PortAND Video HDMI Port. This is for your monitors, there are total of 6. Each monitor has Video Display Port AND HDMI, whichever one you need.RJ45 Port - wired internet connection10G USB-C Peripheral Port10G USB-A Peripheral Port2x 5G USB-A Peripheral PortsSide:Lock Slot.In summary it’s a monster docking station but before you kick out the $ make sure you really need all three monitors because that’s what separates this dock from other, considerably cheaper options.I hope this helps. Happy shopping :)',\n",
       "    \"StarTech is used by many IT professionals because of the quality and performance that their products offer. This latest version of their popular docking stations is quite pricey, to be honest. The advantage is the number of available ports.

I would recommend this for professionals and those with a serious tech habit.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

       "    \"I just love having USB-C level products available to the windows side of the world.  I've reviewed various price points and capabilities in this segment and needless to say the StarTech DK31CHDPD Triple Monitor Dock and HUB is a beast!First off you get a really nice (short) cable that screws into the back of the dock that is your primary TB or USB-C connector with a tail adapter to connect you to a USB-A (3) port if you aren't in the C realm yet.  Note not all USB-C cables are equal!  I had plugged up a 10 footer that was kind of old and all the devices worked except Display Port #1.  I then used the OEM cable and it worked like a champ.  After that I got one of my 10GB/s rated longer cables, tested that successfully as well.I called the support desk about the cable and the guy was swift and aware this dock needs OEM or a higher level USB cable, kudos to fast answer and under one-minute call queue.Great labels for different ports and power charging (or bandwidth) on front and back.  And the front connectors are not 'just for charging'.  Plugging up a Keyboard, mouse drive into the front ports act just like the back ones, found by windows, ready to rock.I'm not an Apple person, we had one MacBook that installed without issue (only tested dual monitors but ports 1 and 2) and one that didn't find any display ports, it was older and most likely needed some drivers.NIC is installed as a Realtek USB GbE Family Controller, Audio as “StarTech audio” and Displays showed connected to “StarTech DK31C3HDPD”.Brick is massive, this is not a portable dock solution, unless your bag has wheels!  Then you'll be prepared to run the entire office from this big daddy!I'm not going to run down a list of ports.  It's in the specs/pictures and I've added some pics of my own.  It comes with 3 power cable options depending on your countries outlets, you are covered.  If you can afford these beast, it won’t let you down.\",\n",
       "    'I have used StarTech items many times over the years as an IT professional and this unit, like their other products, is solidly built; it is a tank.  It is larger than many docking stations, but it does do a lot; the power supply is huge and bulky but the odds of you \"moving\" this around are not great since it\\'s intent is to remain in a fixed position obviously so I am not sure the size is actually a negative in those cases.  IF you intend for it to be \"portable,\" look elsewhere.  I tested all ports with mine on a Windows 10 machine (two of the them) and all of the ports functioned fine for me.  The specs are good and the speed specs are impressive.  The other thing to note is PRICE!  It is up there with other big names such as HP, et al.  Very expensive.  Thus, IF you need all the ports, this is still a good product but be sure you need them ALL; otherwise, there are more affordable alternatives for sure.',\n",
       "    \"COOL MANAGEABILITY FEATUREYou can request a MAC address change software tool from StarTech. This Windows app can allow the laptop's MAC address to broadcast over Ethernet instead of the docking station's ID.PRO--StarTech support, at the time of this review, reads the Amazon Questions posted for this product.--You may be able to get 3 monitors working, depending on ports used, monitor speed and response time expectations.--Good product support on StarTech website,  e.g., including Windows DisplayLink driver and Realtek network adapters.  Live chat may be available at times.--The charging ports are both on the front of the dock.--Some docking stations don't have DP support; this one is versioned at DP 1.4.CON--Documentation about the video port options and constraints could be clearer.--Audio offerings are  minimal (no SPDIF optical, coax or MIDI -- at this price range you'd want avoid a separate audio docking station!)NEUTRALYou may want to skim reviewer commentary regarding the video ports provided. They are not identical, but this may or may not matter depending on your application. This involves the DisplayLink technology and whether / how you're using the TB port.\",\n",
       "    \"You know the story- working from home, and you have a work computer, home computer, multiple monitors, multiple devices, and cables for it all everywhere and you lose your mind trying to juggle it all- while also keeping the cat from chewing the aforementioned cables.This solution made configuring my husband's workstation much simpler to allow him to switch back and forth between work and his personal devices easily without unplugging and plugging in everything. Further reducing the clutter, there's a USB-C and USB-A plug in the front for his phone/Apple Watch charging unit.This device is very well-built and meant for a fixed workstation. To that end, I agree with other reviewers that there should have been mounting brackets. We utilized a solution my electrician husband rigged up (I'm not allowed to post photos of it hahah) and voila. But it would have been nice if, for the price, this device had a nice mounting solution. That's why I docked one star. It kinda felt like they went all out with the rest of the device but the guy who was in charge of engineering the cable management piece was out sick when they signed off on the finished product.\",\n",

This does in fact support 3 monitors. I've seen reviews stating otherwise, and they're mistaken.3. For a docking station this large and with level of functionality, it doesn't run hot. In fact, most the time it doesn't even run warm.4. Not only does every port function to spec, this station doesn't miss a beat even when using the vast majority of ports at the same time.5. I've yet to use this with any set-up where it wouldn't play nice with it.Overall:If you're an IT professional, avid gamer, or both, this is the docking station you want if you need maximum capabilities and a unit that can handle heavy use.Highly recommended5 starsCheers!\",\n",

I am using an external 1080p monitor for my Mac Pro and this docking station working in my setting as it should. The number of ports available on this docking station is definitely a plus. I like that there is a power on/off button so you can turn it off when you are done working. This way you don't have to charge your battery constantly and possibly ruin the battery life. My biggest fear when using this docking station is that it ruins my battery. They could improve this product by adding a switch that can stop charging the laptop when it is sufficiently charged.\",\n",

The instructions were written well and made setup a easier task but I still had a couple of issues as I’m not a techno. The accessories made charging easier because I didn’t have to find the right cables that would push enough power through them for the quicker charge times this docking station can do. But the three monitors are helping me get certain tasks done easier and with less time flipping back and forth trying to remember numbers for the other screens. Definitely has increased my productivity with just the addition of the extra screens Four Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!',\n",

So I\\'m unable to use higher refresh rates, and am still required to use a separate USB-C to DisplayPort cable, rather than rely on the Dock. Very disappointing. Beyond that, it works fine, but it seems like each display is limited to HBR2 speeds. Perhaps it relies on DisplayPort 1.4 + MST to provide the dual 4K support (two HBR3 lanes per display). Wish they did a better job calling this out in the extensive FAQ on monitor support.Using a DisplayPort cable that I know is cable of HBR3 data rates, macOS\\' AGDCDiagnose tool only reports an HBR2 connection to the dock and display, and it will only hold a steady connection at 3840x1600 @ 85Hz (100Hz is listed as an option for my display, but won\\'t hold a connection). No option for 120Hz which I use regularly through this same cable from a Windows PC, and using a USB-C to DisplayPort cable with this same Mac.As far as the rest of the functionality, it\\'s fine. If I didn\\'t want the high refresh rate support, this would be a perfectly usable dock.',\n",
       "    'I use this dock for both a MacBook Pro 15\" (2019) and a Razer Blade Stealth 13\" (2020), both of which support Thunderbolt 3. It works well for both (although with the Blade Stealth I get a popup about the dock not supplying sufficient power -- I assume this is a false-positive based on detecting the power adapter model, not the actual power it supplies).The dock has worked well so far (with one exception, which I\\'ll get to later). Occasionally the MacBook has issues detecting the USB devices attached to the dock, but this problem is specific to the MacBook, and it also occurs when using the official Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter, so this bug appears to be on Apple\\'s side.Unfortunately, I have noticed an issue when using HDCP-protected video when the dock is connected via Thunderbolt 3. Specifically, while connected to the Blade Stealth\\'s TB3 port, if HDCP is enabled (e.g. by starting the Netflix Windows 10 app), the external monitor shows static for a couple seconds, then turns off. This does not occur if I use a USB-C to DisplayPort 1.4 cable connected to the same port on the Blade Stealth. Also of note, this does not occur if I connect the Plugable dock to the non-Thunderbolt USB-C port the Blade Stealth offers: it specifically happens only when the Plugable dock is connected to the Thunderbolt 3 port. I suspect this to be an issue with the dock and plan to follow up with Plugable support. I\\'ll update this review if the situation improves after contacting support.',\n",

Unfortunately I have been grappling with annoying lag in my mouse input. It basically stutters every 2 seconds when you move around the mouse. I contacted the Plugable support but they blame it on the MacOS HDCP issue. They asked me to provide feedback to Apple which seems a bit too farfetched tbh. I can't just keep waiting for Apple to get back to me and fix this issue. There is some chatter on Apple forums about this but no official communication from them. I had expected a better seamless experience when I spend couple of hundred bucks on a docking station.Plugable support informed me that they have gotten many other reports about this same issue, so I would suggest be mindful of this before you make this purchase.

It even provided charging power to the laptop.Unfortunately, any time I connected a monitor to HDMI port 2 the monitor would intermittently flash out and back in. Plugable support was polite and responsive. They provided a debug application that gathered details of my system. They even provided a link to update the Intel Iris Xe Graphics driver.

This is not an issue for viewing videos and photos, but it is most apparent if you look at colorful text and simple graphics.

Sometimes this works, and sometimes I have to go through this little dance several times before everything is back to normal. Then I have to put all my windows back where I left them, since they're all crammed onto the built-in display after waking from sleep.The Plugable dock is a solid, heavy unit with plenty of ports for my needs. I've now got a single Thunderbolt cable running from the Mac to the dock, and two HDMI cables running from the dock to the monitors. Since receiving the unit, I've not had trouble getting the Mac to recognize the monitors on wake from sleep.

No additional packages had to be installed and it has been running for a few hours now without disconnecting (all other docks I have tried suffered from this).

       "    \"I bought a new M1 Mac and since it only comes with two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, I decided to add a quality hub to go along with it.  I have this connected to a second monitor via HDMI and the 5 rear USB ports are in use but not the front.  Those 5 are taken up by two external hard-drives, a USB keyboard/mouse switch (to alternate with my work computer that I also switch the monitor between), a Focusrite Scarlett Solo audio interface and a Fender LT25 guitar amp interface (which is usually shut off).  Everything has been working without a hitch except for one thing:  Ethernet.  I actually returned my first purchase and had it replaced with another of the same because I thought I had a faulty product with a bad ethernet port.  I did change the ethernet cable before-hand and I also swapped to a different ethernet outlet to one that was being used by another device (Apple TV) which had no problems.  Neither helped and my internet connection would just die off or become extremely slow.  This would usually last anywhere from a few minutes to hours.  If I remove the ethernet cable, my Mac would switch to wifi and I'd instantly be surfing along just fine again.My replacement is here and I'm having the exact same issues.  I'm being a bit stubborn about sticking with ethernet over wifi since I went through the trouble of routing a cable to my home office.  Now, I found my working solution is to ditch the ethernet port on this altogether.  I've replaced it with a simple USB-C ethernet dongle and I've had no issues since.  It does take up that second thunderbolt port on the Mac but I still have my front 10-gbps port from this unit so I guess I can live with it.  It's unfortunate to just not have the feature of the docking station available to me, though.\",\n",
       "    \"UPDATE: Plugable's support was helpful in me understanding what the problem is. As of 2-13-21, MacOS Big Sur is not compatible with the drivers required for the Ethernet and USB chipset for the hub. This chipset is the Realtek 8153, and many (if not most) TB3 hubs are using this. This means that many hubs from all brands will simply not work in Big Sur, at the very least if you aren't willing or able to disable SIP and use the older KEXT drivers. New DEXT drivers have not be written yet.If you are planning on buying a TB dock and are using Big Sur, research what chipset is being used and whether it is compatible with the OS. Unfortunately, good support aside, I cannot increase my rating of this device. Nothing other than the display connections work, and those have issues (likely OS and not device related). I am holding onto it until the end of my return period in case drivers are produced. If that happens, I will gladly update this review.Why Apple would release an OS that has no drivers available for a *widely* used chipset is beyond me. I know it's more on the fault of Realtek, but Apple could have engineered their own solution, incorporating it into their drivers. If you have a hub or dock without working ethernet in Big Sur, it likely has this Realtek or ASIX chipset.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Displays sometimes wake back up in the wrong resolution. It's possible that's a MacOS problem. However, the big issue is that the usb ports FREQUENTLY lose USB signal. When I can't use my mouse and keyboard the dock is functionally useless. Do not buy this dock.I have no idea why we're still pushing a technology that hasn't fully worked in 11 years. There are no truly fully-functional TB3 (and going back to 1 and 2) docks it seems.\",\n",
       "    'I am giving this four stars even though this did not work for me. The support was excellent and I think that this dock is an excellent choice for anyone willing to understand that it might not work for you, but if it does work as expected, it will be an excellent choice. It is solid material and as far as I am aware is one of two docks that supports full 96W charging (the other also made by Plugable).I had the following problems with this dock, using it with a Macbook Pro 16 and two 4K LG displays:- HDMI port worked about one out of every three times that I would plug in it- When using both displayports, the identity of the two monitors would appear to be the same, causing display settings to be incorrect whenever the dock was plugged in.- The audio jack did not work at all. It did not show up in the system as an audio device.- When the dock was plugged in, the Apple Magic Mouse 2 would stutter periodically.- Probably the biggest problem of all: When the computer would go into sleep mode, the whole home network would shut down, which I discovered was due to a \"broadcast storm\". This issue, as it turns out, was a known issue and had a fix - namely to ask Plugable support for an updated driver for the Realtek ethernet chipset. I would have done that if not for the other issues.I do wonder if maybe the other issues that I had would have been resolvable by simply installing the Realtek driver? (i.e. maybe the ethernet issues were somehow overwhelming the thunderbolt bus causing the other problems?) I decided that I spent way too much time with it and just wanted to return it though. Fortunately, their support team was incredibly responsive and kind with me, dealing with these issues, and I had no problems returning it.I actually have a plugable Thunderbolt 3 dock from 2017 that works perfectly with the Macbook Pro 16 (ironically had some minor issues with an older 2017 MacBook pro), so I am just going to continue to use that one. The biggest reason that I was replacing this was to get the 96W charging. But, after all of the hassle of trying to get this to work, I realized it is so much easier to just plug/unplug a second charging cable.I still am giving this four starts though, assuming that this was just a faulty dock and that they can\\'t all be like this. Maybe I am being too optimistic? But, if you read the reviews of other docks, it seems like there are always going to be some duds. I can at least attest for this one that the support from Plugable has been great.One more thing that I will mention is that I actually tried this and the other 96W one from Plugable titled \"Plugable Thunderbolt 3 and USB C Docking Station with 96W Charging\".  That one had similar problems with the displays and the missing audio port. I did not test that one with ethernet, but I suspect that it would have had the same issue. Again, an issue that is resolvable with a driver that you need to ask Plugable support to send you.',\n",
       "    \"1) IntroductionAlright, after an hour of extensive use of the dock, I think it's time to write a review about this baby. Usually I don't write reviews on Amazon, but for Plugable, I'll make an exception.I live in Belgium and like the rest of the world, our lives have been affected by COVID-19. My boss told us to work from home, but I still have to go to the office and visit customers occasionally. I don't want to plug/unplug all the cables when I leave home, so it's time to buy a docking station for my laptop (HP ZBook 17 Gen 3).After some research I've decided to pick this dock mainly because of it's display connectivities. It supports up to 2 DisplayPort OR 2 HDMI monitors in 4k 60 Hz. I'm not sure if you can mix DisplayPort with HDMI though.This dock doesn't come cheap. When I first added it to the shopping cart, Amazon said 309.70 EUR (374,89 USD import taxes + shipping included). But after selecting the coupon and subscribing to Amazon Prime (1 month free trial), the dock is discounted to 221.47 EUR. The price is still very steep, but uh, good quality comes with a premium price and that's what I'm willing to pay for, because this dock screams high quality.2) DeliveryThe dock was delivered pretty quickly. I ordered the dock on 30th November and ETA should be 24th December to 30th December, but Amazon gave me a surprise: the dock was delivered today (8th December). I was at the bike store for maintenance when UPS came. So the delivery guy left a note for me to pick up the dock. Luckily the pickup point was not that far, so I traveled by bike.3) UnboxingI pretty much know exactly what's in the box, so no surprises here. One thing that bothered me though, the dock came with a US power socket (actually not surprised). Luckily I still have some universal sockets lying around, so no biggie here.4) SetupAfter some struggle with cable management with my Ikea Bekant, I can finally switch on the dock (no power button, just plug in the power socket). Windows 10 immediately recognized the dock and started to set it up (installing drivers?). After a minute or so, the dock is ready to be used and a thunderbolt icon is added to the notification area.5) DisplaysAfter plugging in the HDMI cables, I've got 2 black screens. So I pressed Winkey + P to extend the displays and voila, I got some nice (distorted) images on my main monitor (Samsung CRG9, also bought it for WFH). Still no images on my second monitor (10 year old Dell U2711). After some checks, I noticed the HDMI cable came loose on the Dell. Plugging it back in solved the problem.Although I got images on both monitors, the resolutions were messed up (hence distorted). So I opened up Nvidia control panel to add some custom resolutions (I did this many times before, so no need to google). So 5120x1440 for the Samsung and 2560x1440 for the Dell. The image quality is now perfect. The refresh rate is also working like advertised (tested with testufo.com). One small issue though, for some reason the Dell won't turn on when the laptop display is on. So instead of extending the displays, I just display the second and third monitors in Windows, problem solved. This is my setup anyway before buying the dock, so no biggie here again.6) NetworkingI've only tested copying files from a remote desktop session. For some reason I can't access files on SMB shares on my desktop computer and vice versa. Maybe the corporate firewall software on my laptop is blocking it. I only get 10 MB/s via remote sessions. I expect the LAN speed will be much higher (100 MB/s) when copying files via SMB. The WAN speed is fine though. I'm getting close to 280 Mbit/s. Which is as fast as plugging in the ethernet cable directly to the laptop.7) The restI didn't test the audio port, because I'm too lazy to unplug the audio cable connected to my CRG9 (it's not easy to access the back panel). I play music with my Sony SRS-XB22 via Bluetooth anyway.I also didn't test the 5 USB3 type A ports (back), the USB3 type C port (front) and the SD card slots. I have no need for those ports at the moment, but I expect they'll work without any issues.I did test the front USB3 type A port though. My 3 year old OnePlus 5 charges just fine. I can also access files on my phone. So I am a happy Man (capital M because my last name is Man, no pun intended).8) VerdictAlthough I haven't tested everything on the dock (some day I will), I'm already very satisfied with my purchase. I feel like you can throw everything at the dock and it can handle it just fine. That's the price you pay for. Tiptop quality. 220 EUR is lot of money, but it spares me a lot of hassle every time I leave home for work. For someone who's constantly on the road, it's worth every penny.Cheers,Kevin\",\n",
       "    \"I like to use my MacBook Pro like a desktop computer - but to drive the external monitors, wired Ethernet, USB devices and charge it required a mess of cables plugged into both sides of the laptop.  It was really inconvenient to plug in and remove when I wanted to take it with me.I tried an inexpensive USB-C dock - but it turns out that while it would drive both external monitors they had to mirror each other.I went with a more expensive USB-C dock that supported multiple independent monitors for Mac, but it used a technology called DisplayLink that works more like a Remote Desktop than a true monitor connection - and it wasn't compatible with using the MacBook with its screen closed (clamshell mode).This device ended up doing everything I need.  Both my 2K monitors are operating independently and at full frame rate - and I can still use the MacBook screen if I want.  All my USB devices are working well - including a camera and a backup drive.  The only limit I've seen so far is my wired Ethernet speed peaks around 800Mbps, but that's fine.I was pleasantly surprised how well built everything is.  It came with a premium Thunderbolt 3 cable for connection to the laptop and a quite hefty power supply.I also like that there are USB-C, USB-A and SD card ports on the front.  Apple may have moved on, but most of my other devices have not.Pluggable says the USB-C port won't charging - but it seems to work fine to recharge my Apple Keyboard and Trackpad.  Perhaps they mean it doesn't support PD (power distribution) like the rear port does.  The USB-A port does officially support device charging and is a SuperSpeed 10Mbps port.Really happy with my purchase - it's pricey compared to the USB-C options, but only Thunderbolt truly supports extending the MacBook's native capabilities.\",\n",

I don't like having extra cords on my desktop or having to switch monitor inputs, I just wanted to plug one cord into any computer and have it work.  This lets me do that.I've been using it for a week with my Mac, my USB-C Windows work computer, and a Windows personal computer that has Thunderbolt.  No issues with any of them.  Some reviews mention issues with Ethernet, but I'm connecting all computers via WiFi, so I haven't used the Ethernet port.  My monitors are hooked up via DisplayPort, this dock supports both that and HDMI.  I haven't tried using sound through it, yet, nor have I tried the card reader.

To say the least this is beyond annoying. I\\'ve experienced this with other docks prior. It is like it can\\'t handle the multiple devices at once, or there is interference causing this issue. I plug an older cheapo USB C adapter that has just network, USB A into the dock, plug monitors into the  Macbook directly, works perfect. Tried everything, no idea why this dock has the issue. Tried a bluetooth mouse, same problem! Different USB wireless keyboard/mouse, same thing!!! The power was seemingly fine it could provide, the video was a bit sketchy though.

Contacted Plugable and they were able to identify the issue in a few hours. Suggested uninstalling my NVIDIA drivers and reinstall with the 442.76 version driver.

However it stil can tip over with little provocation and worst of all the very light power cord is commingled with the heavy other cables. Result: moving the hub around inevitably pops the power cord out, causing hard drives to dismount in the worst way, blanking screens, just generally making a huge (possibly destructive) mess. My solution was to lay the device on its side and tape it to the back of my desk. But I shouldn’t have to do that for something this expensive.At a minimum the power port should be moved to another face of the box and it should latch into place or be covered so it can’t pop out.

Right now my ATEM and my Stream Deck both have to be connected straight to the laptop.  I've experimented with cables, including buying expensive Plugable branded cables.  Nothing helps, and it is totally unpredictable which devices will fail, or when.And if you're thinking that anybody can get a lemon, we bought two of these - the other was for my wife's home office.  We are having the same problems with both of them.  I've got 500 bucks invested in two paperweights.

And subjectively, I think it looks better as I like the more subtle outside finish of the dock... because after all, it is a dock.

I have 2 Dell S2721QS (4k@60hz) monitors and they run great on this dock.  Initially I had some flickering but I quickly found it was because Dell thinks its smart to include HDMI cables that don't even support 4k@60Hz.  So make sure you are using supported DP or HDMI cables.  People often overlook that when troubleshooting docking station issues.  Anyhow, it is working great for me on my Dell Latitude 7400 as well as on my 2018 inch Macbook Pro.  And they charge fast.

       "    \"I have been reviewing Thunderbolt docks since the first ones hit the market 8 or 9 years ago. They offer a lot of great features with just a single cable connection, and the latest iterations can power laptops too. But this one really stands out (in a good way) for a host of reasons:1. It provides a lot of power, just short of 100 watts, for larger laptops like the Macbook Pro 16. Note that more power hungry laptops like the Dell XPS 15/17 and gaming laptops will still need their power adapter.2. A total of seven USB ports along with useful accessories like gigabit ethernet and a card reader. You get Five 5gbps USB-A ports on their own hub on the rear, and a pair of 10gbps ports on the front (one USB-C and the other USB-A). Note that all of the onboard ports and accessories share a single 10gbps bus back to the host computer.3. Flexible display options: while it has four display outputs you can only use two at a time. BUT you have a choice of DisplayPort or HDMI on each pair. Typically docks have HDMI or DisplayPort but not both.4. It's compatible with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3/4 equipped PCs - if you have a shared office space this is ideal as the dock will work regardless of the connectivity standard. The only limitation is that USB-C will allow only a single 4k display at 30hz while thunderbolt will handle 2 at 60 hz. There's also a Kensington lock slot to keep it secure.My only wish here is that it had a Thunderbolt pass-through port for attaching additional Thunderbolt devices. My current dock has a 10 gig ethernet adapter in the pass-through port that I was unable to connect to this one.Check out my video review in the section above to see how it works with a number of devices including the new Apple M1 Silicon Macs and USB-C equipped Windows devices.\",\n",
       "    'The dock arrived in a sturdy heavy-duty branded package with specifications on the back.  The video specifications are fairly extensive as is the case with most Plugable products but it would be nice if the charge current for the various USB ports were also specified.First impression: This thing is built like a tank with 2mm thick extruded aluminum solid exterior in a space-gray finish with subtle laser-etched logos and markings.  The ends are soft-touch silicone rubber.  It is heavy, very solid-feeling and oozes quality.  I\\'ve been very happy with other Plugable products and this doesn\\'t disappoint.Another indicator of Plugable\\'s product quality is the fact that this dock arrived intact and in perfect working order despite the fact that Amazon shipped it to me in an unprotected plastic bag - not even a scrap of bubble wrap to protect the product.  Kudos for Plugable, boos for Amazon\\'s warehouse.Included with the product are a weighted stand for vertical mounting, a heavy duty 170W power supply, a long 2.6\\' Thunderbolt 3 cable and a quick-start guide that frankly you don\\'t really need.  The long cable is a nice touch - I have several TB3 docks and most include a much shorter cable as they\\'re cheaper to make.  The power supply has a long DC power cable with attached velcro strap for cable management and a short 3\\' AC power cord.The dock has tons of useful ports and features.  On the front are a USB-C 10GBps data only port, a USB-A BC 1.2 charge/data port, an audio I/O port, and UHS-II SDHC/ microSD slots.  On the back are the TB3 port with 96W PD charge support for computer attachmentt, 5x 5GBps USB3 ports, 2x video ports with both Displayport 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 connectors, a gigabit ethernet port, and for those that need it a pair of holes in the aluminum case for attaching security cables.The arrangement of ports on this dock is optimal for my dual 4K monitor standing desk setup.  The rear ports are for laptop, monitor and other permanently attached accessories, and the front ports for temporary attachment of phone, camera, etc.  I really appreciate the fact that this TB3 dock has the newer generation Titan Ridge chipset with the TB3 port on the back since the cable arrangement lets me keep my desk very neat and tidy without cables going every which way.The 96W power delivery supports all current model laptops and is more than enough for my 13\" Macbook Pro.  In use the dock gets warm to the touch but not hot.  I\\'ve had zero issues with the included long TB3 cable - it\\'s clearly higher quality than typical and obviously meets spec.I\\'ve collected quite a few TB3 docks mainly because they all had various display-related issues.  My Promise TB-300 (dual HDMI) and Wavlink (Displayport/USBC) docks have good features like SD card readers but on the Mac HDMI doesn\\'t work well with color management and both docks have had display detection glitches.  My Belkin TB Dock Plus looked good on paper with Titan Ridge, compact design, dual Displayport 1.4 and USB-C charge/data ports, but in practice it there aren\\'t enough A ports and has overall been the worst of the bunch with frequent display detection and sleep issues.In contrast I\\'ve had very few display issues with the Plugable dock.  Display topology changes (such as opening the laptop or attaching/detaching the dock) are fast and immediate, and my displays wake immediately without lag.  That alone is worth the price of admission with this dock!This dock also excels with SD card performance.  SD card performance can be highly variable depending on the interface and chipset.  I use a Lexar 2000x memory card with my camera (rated 300MB/s).  The Plugable delivers better read (250MB/s) performance with this card than any other reader I have.  Write performance (150MB/s) outperforms all but my dedicated USB3 CF/SD reader.  For me that\\'s more than good enough!The one issue I\\'ve found is that the USB-C port on the front doesn\\'t seem to support power delivery for charging which makes this port less useful than it might otherwise be.Compared to the rest of the docks I have the Plugable dock has been the best of the bunch.  Although this dock is priced toward the higher end of the range for this type of product ($350 MSRP, currently $250 on Amazon) the combination of features and functionality is more than worth it.When deciding on TB3 docks for your Mac this dock should be high on your short-list.',\n",
       "    \"I got this with hopes of it replacing my Dell OEM dock on a multi-monitor setup. I have 2x4K displays and one HD display. I was really hoping that this unit wouldA) Run the two 4K monitorsB) Run the laptop with power.Alas it appears to do neither. Its a dell lattiude business laptop. When I use the HDMI cables it will run one monitor in 4K and the other in HD. The third monitor runs off the laptop itself.Also on reboot the laptop says that its not getting enough power.So this is kind of a bust. I have a small 4K splitter that costs a bit more that costs 15% of what this costs that allows the two 4K monitors to work, so I know its possible. I was just hoping for something that required less plugging and unplugging.Your performance may vary, maybe a different brand of laptop will work, but for this one it doesn't do anything better than a dock that is 1/3 the price for my needs.Overall though it is well build, has lots of plugs, really wished it would have worked.\",\n",
       "    \"Plugable USB-C Dock 14-in-1 with Thunderbolt 3 Certification, Up To 96W Charging, Dual Monitor - Compatible with Mac and Windows, 2X DisplayPort and HDMI 2.0, 7X USB, Ethernet, Audio, Micro SD/SDI've used quite a number of Plugable products over the years, and have been pretty happy with all of them, including several other USB-C and Thunderbolt docks, so I'm a fan of the brand.  And this particular Thunderbolt 3 Dock doesn't disappoint.First off its built like a tank with heavy duty all aluminum construction, and its fit and finish are excellent as well.  It can be used horizontally or vertically.  It comes with a 170 watt power brick and can provide up to 100 watts of USB-C Power Delivery.  It also includes a brief instruction manual, 2.6 foot 40gbps Thunderbolt 3 cable, and a two year warranty.Next, it includes a good variety and quantity of ports that include: • Front  ○ MicroSD and SD card slots  ○ 1 USB-C 10gbps  ○ 1 USB-A 10GBPS  ○ 3.5mm combo mic/speaker jack • Rear  ○ 5x USB-A 3.0 ports  ○ Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 jack  ○ 2 pairs of DisplayPort/HDMI ports to support up to two 4K @ 60hz monitors  ○ 1 Thunderbolt 3 port (USB-C compatible but at reduced monitor resolutions)  ○ Power In jack  ○ Kensington lock portI've tried it on Windows 10 machines with both Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C connections, and on a Chromebook with USB-C, and everything worked flawlessly, and without any driver downloads.  Its monitor, ethernet, and SD card performance were all very good.  All of its USB-A and USB-C ports performed well on a variety of keyboards, mice, cameras, headsets, flash drives etc.On the negative side, it does not seem to support a 5K monitor, and does not seem to support two 4K @60hz monitors if using USB-C rather than Thunderbolt.  I'm not sure why given these things are supported by some other Thunderbolt and USB-C docks, so keep this in mind when considering this dock.  On the very minor side, there is no on/off switch or power LED.Overall this is a premium built, very good Thunderbolt 3 dock, and a good USB-C dock from a reputable company with a good warranty and good customer service.\",\n",
       "    \"I love doing tech reviews and I really like testing products out before I do the actual review. I've had this for about two months and here is what I have.Pros:1. I absolutely love all the ports that this offers. I love how it has HDMI and DVI display port giving you options to use what works best for you.2. The 6 USB-A 3.0 ports are awesome. There is one in the front and five in the back giving you all the ports you need if you have a wired keyboard, mouse, headset for work, etc. These are also great if you want to charge your cell phone or something like that much faster. I am so glad they used 3.0 instead of the old 2002 USB-A 2.03. I Absolutely love that this dock can charge my device while I'm using it. I have a brand new MacBook that requires 96W charging power and I love how this has 100W with 96W certified. My laptop stays charged with zero issues.4. The gigabyte ethernet port works phenomenally. I've tested it over the course of these two months and I have gigabyte Internet here in Phoenix Arizona which is the best available in the area. After close to two months of testing, this consistently kept me around the 1 GB speed.5. This works awesome with my personal laptop which is a MacBook and my work laptop which is a Dell. **REMINDER** Before buying this make sure your device is Thunderbolt3. This only works with Thunderbolt3 devices. Just because your laptop has a USB-C port does not mean it is USB Thunderbolt3 supported, so please make sure your device supports Thunderbolt3 OR this will not work.6. I also really like and utilize almost daily the USB-C port on the front of this device. It allows you to transfer up to 10 GB of data which is phenomenal especially if you are importing, exporting, editing video, or high-quality photos. This is awesome!7. I know it is hard to find these days but if you are looking for a dock/hub that has a mic in/audio in port then this has it and will be exactly what you're looking for.8. On the back of this dock there are two slotted sections for your extra displays. Each section has a DVI and an HDMI port in order to give you a choice between the two. This does NOT display 4 extra monitors, they are just there to give you an option between DVI and HDMI. When utilizing this you are able to extend or mirror two extra monitors.9. I like the style of the stock. And allows you to stand it up with an attached stand piece or you can use it alone and lay it down.Cons:1. While I absolutely love this dock I will say that I feel the price of $250 is just a bit expensive. There are a lot of name-brand and non-name-brand docks out that are not as expensive and do the same thing. I really say this because there are other docks out there that work just as well and also work with Thunderbolt3 and without Thunderbolt3 devices while this one only works on Thunderbolt3.Overall I am still giving this an absolute 5 ***** rating. It's an awesome dock that has every port that you could want and works phenomenally. Again, as just a reminder, this only works on Thunderbolt3 devices so make sure yours is a Thunderbolt3 device before purchasing.\",\n",
       "    \"I've tried quite a number of docking stations over the last couple years trying to find a perfect one that works with both my Windows PCs (Dell XPS models) and Macs.  This is as close as I've gotten to perfection, even if Mac compatibility isn't as good as one might hope.It has a lot of connectivity -- two monitors in either DisplayPort or HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, 5 USB 3.0 ports on the back, and two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports on the front -- one USB A and one USB C. There's also SD and Micro SD card readers. Very handy, especially when paired with computers that ONLY have Thunderbolt or USB-C (*cough Mac*).Everything works perfectly with my Dell XPS laptops, with the exception of charging power. And that is a limitation of the USB-C standard for Power Delivery. It's limited to 100 Watts, and my XPS models are much happier with 135 watts. So they'll run, and everything seems normal, but they do post a warning message each time I plug in that they might not be able to charge the battery. I've never seen any other odd behavior.Things aren't quite so rosy on the Mac side. No matter what I do I can only get it to work with a single monitor with my Macs. The just don't want to see the second monitor.  I have another dock from Plugable that does allow multiple monitors with my Mac, but for some reason it won't on this one.But other than that one issue I'm really happy with this. Of all of the docks I've tried, this is the one I'm going to stick with and keep using.\",\n",
       "    'QUICK SUMMARY: I\\'m very happy with this dock! It\\'s space-saving, upright design makes it better for my home office. All my tested functions work well. Recommended!BACKGROUND: Since the Covid19 pandemic, I\\'ve been working from home, slowly upgrading my home office to better fit my life. I was using another dock that I liked, but I like this Plugable-branded dock even more because of its vertical orientation and a USB port on the front side. When you have a small desk to begin with, that already has two 24\" monitors and my laptop and more, saving a few square inches is very important!!WHAT I LIKE:- Everything I tested works well- Using two 24\" monitors via HDMI was completely plug-and-play- My wireless mouse\\'s dongle plugs into the single, FRONT USB port, so I got rid of an extra USB hub I was using- The memory card reader works fine- My Dell XPS 13 and a Dell Inspiron work laptop both work/charge fine via Thunderbolt USB-C connection- The power-on indicator on this dock is a faint blue light, not a blindingly bright blue LED!There is nothing I dislike about this Plugable dock. The only thing I could suggest is that the faint power-on blue light could actually be a little brighter than it is, because it\\'s so faintly lit that it\\'s a little hard to notice. But that is much better than having a blindingly bright blue LED light, so I\\'m not really complaining!CONCLUSION: I like Plugable-branded products and this Plugable Thunderbolt dock is an excellent upgrade to my home office. Highly recommended, especially if you\\'re trying to save some desk surface space!',\n",
       "    'This Plugable external Thunderbolt 3 Hub is the ideal choice for my laptop use to let me use a separate display while home. It has a huge number of well implemented features with top quality electronics - for example the certified 20Volt 170 Watt power brick is a \"LiteOn\" Brand - a known top notch power source provider that many laptop and monitor makers use.This device uses an Intel Chipped Thunderbolt 3 cable to connect to my laptop Thunderbolt 3 port. This gives the high bandwidth (40 GbPS) needed to run an external monitor while doing other data streaming; the device supports TWO monitors and has both HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort dual output plugs. This has way more features than I will use, see the listing for additional details. If I use a USB C cable for primary connection the bandwidth is of course reduced - Thunderbolt is the way to go for best results.Picture 1 shows what I received. The Plugable Case is attractive thick brushed aluminum with the option to stand it on end using the provided weighted base (my choice) or put it horizontal without the base. It is compact and stable even with a lot of cables attached. Picture 2 shows the huge number of active Ports in/out. Six USB 3 Ports, a SuperSpeed 10GbPS USB C and USB 3 Ports are there. A high speed Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 jack is there too! This device is Superior in all respects! Picture 3 shows the backside. Did I mention there is even an SD Card reader incorporated? Wow!I had absolutely no difficulty setting this up, powering/recharging my laptop, and using the USB 3 Ports for data at high speed. This thing is wizardly and works without separate software, the OS does recognize it whether I use Apple (MacBook Pro) or Windows 10 OS. The instructions are basic but most anyone can plug stuff together and try it out; I had zero problems. I have not needed nor tried their Seattle based email support.I Highly Recommend this Plugable USB-C Dock! It is top quality with excellent value, a 2-year limited parts and labor warranty and is very full featured.',\n",
       "    'I used this with my chromebook and my pocket laptop to setup a full desk setup for me to be able to just move my work to a \"desktop environment\" with a single cable. For the most part this dock worked well except for dual monitor support (as is the case with basically every one of these dual monitor docks). Both monitors don\\'t just work out of the box and most laptops don\\'t support dual streams over USB-C.Instead one monitor is a \"displaylink\" monitor that is basically a secondary small GPU that is inside of this dock.... that means that there is inferior performance from video applications (and forget gaming) on that monitor. Instead there is one real monitor and a second monitor for \"reference\" like text and other mostly static stuff.Therefore I think it is a bit disengenuous for any \"dock\" to claim it to be dual or triple monitor without the displaylink problem being front and center.When I used this dock with one monitor, it works great and I can have a desktop-like experience. The single cable for charging also allows me to not have to worry about my laptops charge (as long as I am using one of my laptops with a USB-C charging port) when using the dock.Overall this dock is nice and works well outside of the dual monitor claims.',\n",
       "    \"I bought the TBT3-UDZ to work kind of like a hi-speed KVM switch (plus charging capability) for 2 fairly new Windows 10 laptops I have.  I wanted to be able to use 1 cable (the TB3 cable) to conveniently switch a keyboard + dual-monitor + mouse setup from one laptop to the other.So far it is doing a good job of that.  When I received the TBT3-UDZ, it came with simple instructions for powering it on, connecting the 'host'  (one of my laptops), and then connecting devices (monitors, plus whatever USB devices you want).  The connections worked properly the first time with no hassles, and I have not noticed any problems since then, though it is early days.  I will return here to add updated comments if I notice any issues, but so far, so good.I think this kind of 'just works' experience is what everyone wants with a dock, but it seems challenging sometimes to actually get it with TB3 or USB-C docks.  There are lots of details under the hood with potential for things to go wrong, even though ostensibly the setup is using well-defined communication standards.My setup is not demanding the full video bandwidth.  My two monitors are old 1920x1200 Dell U2412M's and I am using their DisplayPort and DVI inputs to connect to the TBT3-UDZ.  However I have somewhat odd cabling.  One monitor just uses a standard DisplayPort cable between the dock and its DisplayPort input, but for the other, I'm using an HDMI cable connecting the dock to an HDMI-to-DVI adapter, and the adapter to the monitor's DVI input.  It's great that the TBT3-UDZ has DisplayPort and HDMI options for its video outputs, and I've been able to use one of each to get problem-free connections to my older (but still useful) monitors.In some reviews of TB or USB docks, I've read horror stories of intermittent flaky connections, or bad things happening if the laptop is put to sleep or powered down, and then later you want to restore full capability.  I've not experienced any of those kinds of problems with TBT3-UDZ, it works well through sleeps-and-resumes, or laptop reboots.It comes with a 2-foot TB3 cable.  With some fiddling around, I've found a way to make that work on my desk to conveniently connect to other of my 2 laptops.  However the 2-foot length is a bit inconvenient, longer would be better.  I think it's a fundamental challenge for very hi speed cables like 40 Gbps TB3......cable losses at those signal speeds put a practical limit on how long a passive cable can be.  Longer active cables are possible, but more complex and expensive, and the extra complexity can introduce problems.  None of this is a problem about the TBT3-UDZ design directly, but it's a fundamental issue with hi speed TB connections that can affect logistics of your setup.The TBT3-UDZ form factor seems reasonable to me: approximately 7 inches x 4 inches x 1 inch.  It comes with a simple stand to enable it to sit vertically on a desk, and without the stand you can instead lie it horizontally if that works better in your space.  I am using the stand and the vertical orientation.  It is stable with no wobble, and fits well in my space.  The ports are spaced far enough apart for easy connections to my cables, though don't seem unnecessarily far apart to the point that space is being wasted.  The dock has a metal enclosure.  It's barely warm to the touch when active, but not close to being uncomfortably hot.My laptops both have ports that are combination TB3, DisplayPort, and USB type-C.  I'm connecting them to the TBT3-UDZ through one of these ports, using the 2-foot 40 Gbps TB3 cable that was provided.  The single cable connection is simple and convenient.  Also, I like that the 40 Gbps TB3 data speeds mean that the video is not compressed as in lower-speed docks that use the DisplayLink standard.  I understand that DisplayLink is good enough for many use cases, but personally,  I don't want to give up video quality if I'm connecting my laptops to monitors through a dock.  The TBT3-UDZ costs more than some lower speed alternatives, but for me it is providing tangible value that the video is not compressed, and therefore worth the extra cost.Very happy with the purchase overall so far, and would strongly recommend.My laptops are a Dell 7410 2-in-1, and an HP Spectre x360 2-in-1, both using 10th-generation Intel processors.\",\n",

The bottom base is made of silicone and it feels heavy. The surface of the docking station is made of High-quality aluminum alloy, it feels heavy as well, which makes this docking station very solid and stable. and even the type C cable is made of high-quality rubber, I really like this great quality product.The next part is even amazed me more!! It actually supports two HD monitors working at the same time, which I have been having trouble with my other docking station.  It was great at connecting us to multiple devices and allowing my laptop to charge with the type c cable, and the USB ports are allowing high-speed transmission. All in all, everything with its docking station is all great until I found a downside, which is when I connect it to my speaking with cable, it makes a buzzy sound, I believe that is the sound of an electric current. I guess I have to use the Bluetooth speaker instead, and because I love it so much I will still rate it 5 stars.',\n",

The accessories were a very heavy brick to power the tower and a C cable and power cables. The instructions were informative and easy to read and understand and the pictures helped us immediately with setup. We’ve had similar experiences with this type of station so after reading for a bit we had it pretty much set up the way we wanted and had things charging in no time and the monitor up and running. We waited to get the additional monitor because we wanted to be sure it would work before spending even more money. With multiple items charging the large brick is very warm but not overly hot to the touch. We are satisfied and happy with how it is working for us with the ease that the instructions said it would.

This one from Plugable hits all the marks!

All the connections are reliable and solid - no loose plugs!  The unit is powered by a large transformer, but the cords provided are long enough that the brick is comfortably on the floor and out of the way, and it has an extender so that it only takes up one plug on my power strip!

The dock allows use of HDR mode, but when the monitor first awakens after loss of signal it will have HDR mode enabled briefly, then lose HDR, even though macOS still thinks that HDR is active.Plugable\\'s support staff have been helpful investigating this problem, which probably requires some combination of Intel (for the Titan Ridge chipset), Apple (for the MacBook Pro hardware and macOS drivers), and maybe Plugable to correct this incompatibility. Until that happens, there\\'s this annoyance that occurs many times per day. This problem doesn\\'t arise with other Thunderbolt docks, but would probably afflict other docks using the same Titan Ridge chipset as the Plugable TBT3-UDZ.On the upside, the dock does charge the MacBook Pro at the promised 96 watts.',\n",

I don't know if other people had the same problems because I couldn't find discussions online. I thought it could be a USB power issue? Somehow?

It's attached to 2 monitors, 1-HDMI and 1-DisplayPort.  I also tested with 2-HDMI and it works perfectly.  It also charges the laptop with no problem.For the Surface Pro 7 - initially I didn't expect it will allow me to use 2 monitors - since it's a USB-C, but it did same connection as above using 2 monitors and it also charges the device.I also connected it to an older Lenovo Legion Laptop with Thunderbolt (not sure about the specs) it doesn't charge the laptop which is understandable.

       "    \"Pros:- super solid build quality. Love the gun metal aluminum housing, matches my MacBook perfectly- excellent range of ports. Lots of USB 3 ports, and supports dual 4k 60hz displays natively. Actually comes with both DP and HDMI options built int- natively supports both vertical and horizontal placement- delivers up to 96w power- truly converts your laptop into a desktop like experienceCons:- larger than competing modelsOverall:I've been really happy with this TS3 dock from pluggable. Compared to their lower end model, this is more expensive but delivers much more on providing a full desktop like experience with your laptop. People will inevitably compare this to the caldigit TS3 dock which has been the pseudo gold standard for some time now. I'll say that compared to this, piugables dock is bigger, and offers a different array of ports, providing more USB a ports and limiting you a bit more in terms of USB C ports. The other trade off here is native dual 4k displays with built in DP and HDMI ports. The caldigit dock can do this as well but only has a single DP port and requires you to use the other TS3 port to drive your second display.For the money, this is in line with other competing models. This is well built and works as advertised. Pairs great with any USB C based Mac's. If you're in the market for a TS3 dock and are happy with this particular selection of ports, this will work great for you!\",\n",
       "    'I\\'ve received reasonably good service from the dock over the last seven or so weeks, but there are issues. I have a \"newer\" laptop with limited connectivity, so I appreciate being able to disconnect one USB Type C cable when I need to go mobile with it but then have a full suite of connected items on my desktop.I\\'m not going to get into all manner of details on specs. The seller provides those details. This review is about my experience with the device. I do own some other items made by this company, and all of them have performed exceptionally.The 10GBPS speed on the Type C connection (that\\'s all my laptop has, no Thunderbolt) allows for several things going on simultaneously. I can keep two large-capacity external drives continuously connected and, besides just backing up files to them, I can actually work on files that are located on the drives. The USB bandwidth is fast enough that I don\\'t have major lag happening while opening large files.Having many USB ports allows me to run the one dock instead of needing additional hubs. I wish that there was one more Type C connection on the front. For me, this would make it a lot more flexible.While it provides a lot of connectivity, I have experienced some problems that I don\\'t have with other docks, including another Plugable model. There are times when drives connected to it will disappear. I need to unplug/plug them in. And the odd thing is that it doesn\\'t always happen to all of them.I also have times when a monitor connected to it will not show. If I unplug the dock from the laptop and plug it in again, the monitor shows up. This happens when using the HDMI or Display ports and a standard 1920x1080 monitor.I\\'ve gone through Plugables website looking for a firmware update that would solve these issues, but there\\'s nothing related to this model, nor is there any support material that covers these issues.Transfer speeds when using the SD or TF cards ports is as fast as the card will allow for both read and write.Using the ethernet connection, one monitor, and multiple USB 2 and 3 connections, the dock does get warm. It\\'s never become hot, but it does run warm. There is no charging as the laptop has its own power supply, and the USB drives also have their own power sources. The only device that\\'s being powered is the keyboard.Overall it offers a load of connectivity and fast speeds for data transfer.If it weren\\'t for the random disconnects on both external USB drives and the monitor, this would easily be a five-star item, even with the high cost.',\n",
       "    \"With all the power that modern laptops possess, they lack connectivity via ports, which is when a dock comes in really handy.Unlike basic Thunderbolt 3/USB-C docks, which are generally underpowered and limited, this Plugable brand dock offers a massive amount of flexibility and options.Designed to make laptops more desktop-like, this dock can also serve as an expansion for desktop systems.The dock itself is well-made with an aluminum casing and it includes a rather heavy stand if you want it to stand upright on your desk. This is totally optional as you can keep it horizontal.In the box, you get a rather large power brick and a short Thunderbolt 3 cable. The power brick and the cables that go along with it take up more room than the dock itself. This can get clunky if you travel, but unfortunately, there are no options for USB-C PD to power this unit..It's essentially plug-and-play and on my windows systems there was no need for any drivers, however, some people may need to update their Intel drivers to get the display output to work properly.While you can run this through USB-C, it becomes limited in both transfer speeds and display resolution, maxing out at two 1080p displays (vs. two 4k).If you do plan to travel with this or use it outside of your home/office, you'll be happy to know that it is compatible with Kensington locks.If I had to complain about one thing it would be the price. While Plugable hardware is always top-shelf stuff, it's a major investment and out of reach for a lot of people.That said, if you're looking to expand your laptop's capabilities and want a reliable, high-quality piece of kit, then this dock should be on your list.\",\n",
       "    \"This is the second Plugable Thunderbolt dock that I have used and just like it's lower powered cousin, this dock is exceptionally well built. It's sturdy and only gets ever slightly warm despite everything (including a laptop that technically requires 100w but does fine anyways) plugged into it.I really like that this supports both HDMI or Displayport for the two video outputs: while my specific setup is fortunate enough to have two displayport displays, that certainly wasn't true a few years ago and including the options makes this a whole lot more useful to a wider group of people.This dock is very much a one-dock solution which I really appreciate as the last Plugable thunderbolt dock I used which necessitated a separate USB hub.Having used this for a few weeks (and the other Plugable Thunderbolt Dock for over a moth), I really do think there is a strong argument in these docks over the cheapo adapters you can find on Amazon. These are built like tanks, don't ever overheat/throttle and are just a delight in terms of how clean and polished they look on the desk.\",\n",

I was hoping to find one to be able to power 2 external monitors, one of which is 4K.This dock has worked perfectly from 1st minute.  I have bth monitors plugged in, the 4k using Thunderbolt 3 port and the 2nd (2560x1440) using full-size DisplayPort port.  Plus having the gigabit ethernet,  external speaker, and USB port to hang a small hub for keyboard, mouse, and external drive for Time Machine backups.  And all that, and power the Macbook, using just the one port makes easy detach/reattach as I move from home to office and back.Great product.',\n",

Their Thunderbolt 3 docking station was the 3rd attempt at a product that promised a lot but didn\\'t deliver much. To be honest, non-apple (windows based) laptops took a a long time to include a truly functional thunderbolt 3 port. Luckily, Razer was ahead of the power curve. Luckily, \"threes the charm\" as the saying goes. Out of the box to fully functional...would you believe 10 minutes. Everything worked on the first try.  Amazing!Thanks for making this plug and play, instead of plug and pray!cb',\n",
       "    'It looks good, and feels like a quality item, but has a big flaw.Half of the time that I take my 3 month old MacBook pro out of sleep, or just reopen the lid, the display port output from the dock does not send a signal to the monitor (I have two new large external LG monitors).  So I have to reach behind the doc and unplug it, and then wait for the monitors to get discovered by the Mac, maybe 30 seconds.  I wish it just had two HDMI outputs and that they both worked reliably.I also wish the front of it was covered with old style USB receptacles, because as you can see in the picture I had to buy an amazon basics 7 plug USB hub (highly recommended).Given that the dock has a display port issue, I wish it had a power switch on the front so that I could reboot it more easily.I didn\\'t find a good quality alternative from a known company (I am unwilling to send data through a hub from a no-name company, that could be full of spyware).  So I am living with the reboot inconvenience.I might buy one of those foot operated xmas tree extension cords, so I can reboot it more easily.

       "    \"Updated review, Feb 6 2019While indeed this dock works great most of the time, it has proven buggy. At first I thought it was something wrong with my Macbook, but no, it's the dock. When I put my Mac to sleep, sometimes I'll come back and the screens simply won't come on, completely unresponsive. If I disconnect the dock and wait a minute, the Mac's native screen works again. This behavior never happens when not connected to this dock. Similarly, occasionally my Mac won't recognize the dock's connected audio, forcing a restart. I'm looking for a new dock now.Original Review, mid 2018:Just got a brand-spankin' new Macbook Pro 2018 with all the trimmings. This little dock works like a champ - plugged it in, plugged in my two 4k screens, wired ethernet, legacy USB 3 hub with a bunch of accessories hanging off it. This hub _just works_ as the kids say. Competitors' hubs don't provide charge for a 15 inch MBP, this one does. Others look weird, this one looks great on my walnut desk. Money well spent.\",\n",

The unit does not charge my laptop, the unit does not run 2 monitors, the unit does not allow for printer connectivity. I basically have this plugged in to run an extra USB port and one monitor. It is useless, and the seller will not accept a return.',\n",

My hard drives mount properly, their permissions are correct, my monitors sleep and wake properly, and PREMIERE DOESN\\'T CRASH citing power issues anymore. - Power your laptop with an Apple charger and work your ports out a different way. This thing is tragic.The good is that I can now power 2 monitors or 2 bus-powered USB hard drives. - Great.The BAD... is that while reading footage files (I edit video) works fine... I cannot SAVE or WRITE files to my drives. - If I remove those same drives and plug them in one at a time to my other docks... they WRITE just fine. - Kensington does NOT have firmware updates for this device on their website. - Bad ju-ju. - I need and update that fixes my write permissions. - Then I can change my review.',\n",

I have dual QHD monitors attached with one connected to the displayport and the other from the USB C port with an adapter cable (Plugable USB C to DisplayPort Adapter Cable). Everything functions properly with the exception of the power delivery/charging over the TB cable. The 5530 uses a 180 Watt power adapter and the Kensington dock is rated @ 85 Watts. Not a big deal for me, as I was aware of the charging limitation before my purchase.

However, on the PC, no USB peripherals plugged into the dock work unless they're all plugged in when the computer is booted, and on OSX, it takes many attempts to even get the computer to recognize the dock and switch over the monitor, not super convenient for clamshell operation. At this rate, I'm better dropping thunderbolt entirely and buying a much cheaper USB-C hub, especially since TB3 eGPUs and monitors don't seem to work with this product either. Only seems useful for Thunderbolt 3 HDD arrays.I will say, however, when the product finally works, it is operational in all capacities - just without any of the convenience that I expected from a docking solution.\",\n",

Discrete graphics (R555 in my case) runs both monitors very smoothly.  Sleep/wake behavior in MacOS is flawless. Sleep/wake in bootcamp windows 10 is problematic. It’s best to alter your Win10 power settings such that only the monitors sleep. Overall still very pleased with it.',\n",
       "    \"I have a 2019 Macbook Pro, A1990 EMC 3359, the one with the Touch Bar.  The charger that comes with it is 87W.  In theory this dock supplies 85W so you'd think it would work, but slowly over the course of a work day the battery drains and eventually before 5pm the machine shuts off.  I tried two other things that didn't work either--I plugged in headphones to listen to a webcast, and the headphones didn't work; I tried to use my Yubikey in a USB-A port on the dock and that didn't work either.  Useless.\",\n",

Sometimes it would lock up my laptop if I closed the lid while attached. Other times, when I woke the laptop from a lock-screen, the displayport monitor wouldn't turn back on unless I rebooted the dock. Finally, the one USB-C monitor jack on the back died. I now use this dock just to charge my laptop. At least it still does that, for now.\",\n",

       "   'content': ['I\\'m coming from a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Dock Gen 2 (say that one time slowly). The TBT3-Gen2 is pretty awful. I bought this Plugable product on a whim, hoping it would connect and disconnect without needing to do a rain dance. Read on.First, the video ports are DisplayPort. They are not HDMI. If your monitors do not have DisplayPort inputs, you\\'ll need a converter or adapter. Mine are HDMI. I bought two \"CalDigit DisplayPort 1.2 to HDMI 2.0 (DP to HDMI) Active Adapter 4K 60Hz UHD (3840 x 2160), Eyefinity Support\" adapters here on the Amazon.I unboxed the Plugable dock and got right to the plugging part. I plugged in the included 20V power supply, the two monitors (with adapters), then connected my Dell XPS 13 to the dock with the included Thunderbolt 3 cable.Results: Without installing any drivers or performing any magic incantations, the devices all connected and worked, for the most part. USB works great. The network port appeared and configured properly. And the monitors? That\\'s where the \"most part\" comes in.Both monitors are older ASUS VE278 27 inch 1080p. Both were horrendous when connected to the Lenovo dock. Horrendous means each time the computer suspended and resumed, the dock had to be unplugged and replugged a few times to get both monitors to reliably detect.With the Plugable dock, I have to occasionally unplug and replug the dock one time to get the right side monitor to reconnect. I haven\\'t contacted support yet, though I do see someone with a Macbook had a similar problem, and Plugable got right back to them. I have hopes. Even if it isn\\'t solved, the process is 10 seconds, not five minutes (yes, five real minutes) to get the Lenovo dock to work.Overall, I\\'m a fan. I\\'d recommend this product, and I\\'ll be buying another to use at my second workspace.',\n",
       "    \"Plugged the monitors, mouse, keyboard, a couple various USB 2.X and 3.X hubs (off of which are hanging various devices, like a sound card and a webcam) into the unit, plugged in a sleeping MacBook Pro (2019, 16 inch), and the displays lit up, the mouse works, the keyboard works, the sound card works, and the MacBook seems to be charging.  It's only been a few hours, so time will will have to tell if there are any problems, but so far so good.I am a Plugable fan.  Whenever I have to buy some weird USB thing or some hard disk enclosure or some bluetooth adapter or dock or whatever, I always try to see if Plugable makes what I'm looking for because a) in my experience, whatever they sell usually works under all operating systems.  b) if it doesn't, they take great pains to tell you in the description before you buy it.  I really appreciate their products.  Note that this particular unit does not really work under Linux (this isn't a problem for me; they don't say it does); on Ubuntu 18.04, the USB doesn't work, although the displays do.* EDIT... later, I hooked this up to a Lenovo Thinkpad P15 running both Windows and Ubuntu Linux 20.04.  Unsurprisingly it worked with Windows right out of the box (ethernet, displayport, USB, audio).  Surprisingly, it also worked with Ubuntu.  Under Linux, you have to use the NVIDIA proprietary drivers to drive an external displayport monitor, and I only tried one external monitor, but it drove a 4K monitor at 60Hz without issue.\",\n",

I also have issues using dual monitors.  The first problem stemmed from my second monitor only has and HDMI plug in and want recognized with the display port adaptor I originally used. It took some research but I finally found that I needed to use an active HDMI to Device port adaptor.  It would be nice if that was in the instructions or product description so I could have ordered one when I ordered the docking station.  The most frustrating issue is probably not Pluggables problem but I wish the companies would address the problem  The HP has the Radeon video card and regularly reboots due to Wattman setting errors.

HDCP content works correctly without the weird black screen flickering that I get on other usb-c hubs that prevents me from using the monitor for watching movies.The meh:Hot-plugging into the displayports sometimes doesn't trigger the monitor to be detected, and I need to re-plug the thunderbolt cable to get it to detect. However, if I don't touch the display cables, then things otherwise work smoothly. I was hoping that I would be able to use G-sync with my Freesync monitor finally, but unfortunately this dock doesn't seem to support it (no option in NVIDIA control panel), so gamers beware. Using the ethernet port on the dock compared to directly on my personal laptop causes a slight drop in my internet speeds, going from ~600 mbps down to ~450 mbps, so I opted to stick to directly plugging into my laptop instead. That said, topping out at ~450 mbps is still pretty acceptable compared to wifi.The bad (and I am REALLY annoyed by this, especially being the first impression I had of Plugable products):The product I received was clearly an open box (see photos); the seal on the box was obviously not its original seal. The box was bulging from incorrect packaging, one of the product review cards that should have been in the HDMI adapter pouch was outside in the main box, the plastic cover for the plug was not on the plug, and I don't know if there was supposed to be some cardboard at the bottom to hold the power adapter in place, but as you can see, it is able to just slide around inside. There are some very minor scruff marks on the dock itself that I also noticed, signs that someone tried to plug cables into the dock before. This is ABSOLUTELY unexceptionable when the product is marketed and priced as being brand new (this wasn't cheap...). I should have gotten an open-box discount for what I had received.I would have given the dock itself a 5 star, but with the open box issue I would have dropped it to a 1 (0?) star if it weren't for the fact that the dock itself is in fairly pristine condition and all of the functionality seems to be working.\",\n",
       "    'M1 Macbooks are only capable of rendering a display through one of the displayports. If you plug in two, both screens will go black. If you want dual displays, you will need a DisplayLink adapter.The build quality of the product is very high, it has a great metallic feel. The dock is sleek and the charging port works seamlessly. The provided HDMI converter worked wonderfully for the single display I was able to run. If I did not have an M1 Macbook, I would highly recommend this product.'],\n",

The Gram has a i7-8560U CPU @ 1.8 GHz that includes a built-in UHD Graphic 620.  On the Gram there is Intel UDH Graphics Control Panel utility- that will list your external displays once you connect it to the Dual DisplayPort adaptor and then connect the other end to your LG Gram  Thunderbolt 3 port USB-C type port.In the Intel UDH Graphics Control Panel select *Multiple Displays* and then select your displays- after you save the configuration it will Extend Desktop to all 3 displays.  Do not worry if during setup 1 external display is not working.  Once you select save the both externals monitors and built-in monitor display will activate and all monitors will work as expected.Right now - I rate this as a 5 start product!

The older StarTech USB32DP24K60 (60hz adapter) did ok and was 60hz but it just couldn\\'t keep up with window movements so if I dragged a window across an external monitor over the adapter it would lag behind what my mouse was actually doing. This new StarTech Thunderbolt adapter connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on both my Dell 2-1 5290 and my 2018 Macbook pro (in both Mojave and Win10 Bootcamp) works PERFECTLY! No lag, just smooth external monitors. This adapter replaced a Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 eGPU dock at work completely, such that I can take the eGPU home and use it for gaming now.Also to note, the Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 eGPU does not work in MacOS because there\\'s no Mac driver/support for nVidia or the protocol the DisplayPorts on the back use. However, if you manually point the \"Generic Windows Display Device\" in Device Manager from Windows 10 in Bootcamp to the nVidia driver folder manually it picks right up and works great. This requires downloading the nVidia driver and going half-way through the install before it fails saying there\\'s no nVidia in your system. This loads the folder on the C drive which can then be pointed to for manual driver install in the Device Manager. In case any of you were wondering.Back on topic: The Thunderbolt 3 StarTech dual-DisplayPort adapter works perfect. 60hz on two 4K monitors with snappy refresh when moving applications around the external screens.',\n",

I'd recommend this thing if you've got an XPS15 9550 and DisplayPort displays. If you've got one HDMI display, be sure to pick up an active DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 adapter.

Even with only one connected, it shows a \"ghost\" display that my Mac thinks is real.

No drivers or hassles, and it simply works.  The unit is well made, and it has enough heft to stay in place while tugging cables.  It still doesn\\'t seem worth $80.

One thing I noticed is that you need to have the proper cables (the PC hooked into DP), so I ordered HDMI 2.0 certified cables (a must for 4k) from monoprice.  I was careful not to hook any other cables into the T3 bus on that side and put the port extender for USB/etc on the other bus.It worked right away, however no matter what I tried I could only achieve 4K/30Hz.  Since I am not gaming (this is a work laptop) it is not that bad, but you can certainly see the lag in Mac animations.  The view was no better or worse than my VDI connection.  I referenced the Mac (it says it supports dual 60Hz, the LG (it definately works and supports this according to the manual) -- the DP port works at 60Hz, and this product says it works at 60Hz dual.I am suspect of any of these products working at 60Hz, be wary to run dual 4K monitors @60Hz with a 2017 MBP.I picked up a cheap Omotion stand for clamshell mode and I am off to the races.  No docking station needed, so from there a winner.I also think the price is high because there are many offbrands which offer 4k dual at 30Hz for 1/3 the price, so value-wise it does not make it.',\n",

In addition, I couldn't connect to the internet (and I double checked that other devices in the house had internet connectivity).So I took the HDMI-USB-C cable I had been using with my single-monitor set up, and reconnected it.

       "    \"I needed a HDMI to Thunderbolt 3 adapter for my MacBook Pro and I grabbed this based on glowing reviews and the fact that I've had great prior experiences with Sabrent's SSD drives. Well, this adapter was a bust. It started working for about three hours, then there was screen flickering on one of the two screens and it going black at random intervals. I ended up unplugging it throughout the workday, which was maddening after a while. Whenever I did unplug it, I noticed that it was extremely hot to the touch (never a good sign). First, I thought that maybe I had a bad cord, so I bought a pair of new HDMI cords. Nope, still had the same issues. Then I decided to exchange the adapter for another one as it was totally possible I just was unlucky and got a defective one. Nope, still the same issues. The only time the adapter didn't end up flickering was when only one screen was plugged in, which effectively made it useless.Now it could totally be that my two 4K screens could just be too powerful for this little adapter. Perhaps this dongle is using old technology that can only handle one 4K screen at a time. However, if that's the case, they need to relabel their product to state that it can only handle two 2K screens or one 4K screen. Anyway, for those MacBook owners looking for a way to bump up their screen real estate to two 4K monitors, I recommend putting some more money down on a more expensive dock rather than a cheaper adapter like this one.

Not only is it much easier to connect, since it's the same upside down, but it does so much more.Unfortunately, I don't have a single device with more than a single USB C port, so I do appreciate that I can use this adaptor like an HDMI splitter, and get dual screens with a high resolution from my laptop, and one duplicated screen from my Note 8 cellphone.  I don't have a video output that's high enough for this product.  It will be up to date for years.  Two 4K screens?  That's awesome.It's pretty simple to use.  Just plug and play.  USB C seems to supply enough power.  The device was warm after using it for three hours, but not hot, and it never stopped working.One thing I do is give Powerpoint presentations.  A common issue is technical stuff keeping the presentations off a screen, even though where I work is full of podiums with HDMI ports.  I keep this in my bag, connect my cell phone to the screen, and my powerpoint is running just as if it were on a computer.  It really makes me seem resourceful and prepared, and I have peace of mind that no matter what problems pop up, I will have a smooth presentation.Like my Sabrent USB hubs, this is a simple product, with normal plastic construction, but it's sturdy.  I've used those Sabrent hubs for years without any issue, while other hubs have failed.  The cables are attached nicely and should be able to take a little abuse over the years.It's a great product.\",\n",

I have two Windows 10 systems with Thunderbolt 3 ports (not just USB-C), and neither will output anything to displays connected to this device. Windows recognizes the unit, but nothing further.With no drivers clearly available on Sabrent\\'s website, it makes me wonder if this device was rushed to market, with drivers soon to follow. Personally, I find that \"Some Windows Systems\" is enough to steer me away from similarly marked items in the future. YMMV.But that\\'s JustMe.',\n",
       "    \"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I got this Sabrent Thuderbolt3 Dual HDMI adapter because I am using a 2018 Macbook Pro and with my MacBook I only have 4 USB- C ports and that’s it. I do a lot of video editing and graphics and I needed something that would give me the ability to have extra monitors with 4K. I’ve been using this for a while and here are the things that I think are important.Pros:1. THIS ADAPTER DID NOT get hot at all while I was using it and it works great!2. The cable on this Sabrent adapter is longer than most adapter cables which is a big plus.3. If you are only using one monitor, you can use either HDMI port 1 or 2, it doesn’t matter.4. If you want 4K, this truly puts out in 4K and @ 60Hz which was awesome! The blue light indicator lights up and lets you know that the adapter is 4K ready.5. It has the rubber strips on the bottom so you don’t have to worry about scratching your desk and its really light making it easy to just unplug and carry with you.6. This adapter will let you “mirror” or “extend” one or both of your monitor(s). This was the winning touch because I’ve tried other adapters and couldn’t separate the function.Not So Pro:1. The price is a bit high at $89 compared to other adapters out there, but this adapter is true quality and all the reviews will tell you the same.2. This is for ThunderBolt3 devices so if your laptop or PC isn’t ThunderBolt3 compatible this may not work, so make sure.3. It wasn’t a big deal, but every night I put my Macbook in sleep mode before I go to bed and there were maybe 2 times that I had to simply restart my Macbook for the other monitor(s) to be recognized. Don’t know why it happened but it worked like a charm after restart.OVERALL:This is a must have and I would highly recommend this adapter before you go out and buy a bunch of other dongles and/or take “chances” on other ones. This adapter does exactly what it says and I use it daily for multiple hours. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because I wish it had a USB-C charging port on it so I could plug my Macbook's charging cable directly into it. Outside of that, it's a definite 5 star.\",\n",
       "    'This device works great for those type c devices. It works great for the macbook, windows, or even chrome. Be aware that a device can connect to a 4k display using this but the device does not enhance the video output. What I mean is that if the device does not support 4k output the screen will need to be adjusted to the resolution that the device can support. The device is a bit on the large side so if you have a small desk just be aware it will take up a small amount of space. Another thing I would say is the device does get warm when it in heavy use. It does not come with an HDMI cables just the device and it does not require additional power to be used. It also does not work for phones but it can work for tablets. It worked pretty well for my google slate which is nice. It does come with a good length of wire but I would not have it hanging off the side of the desk as you can possibly fray the wire overtime. Overall I think this is a great product to have if you want to have dual screens on 4k monitors/tv. It does the job without any issue to video or pictures just be aware that the device you are plugging this into need to support 4k output to output at 4k level.',\n",
       "    'This is a review for the Sabrent Thunderbolt 3 to Dual HDMI 2.0 AdapterI really like this and recommend it. Here’s why.A big plus is the easy setup: Plug-n-Play; no software or drivers needed.It’s features are great as well. There’s not just a USB3 to 4K adapter but a USB3 to dual 4K adapter. The adapter device is not too large-2/3, the size of a 2.5” external flash drive. It has a soft blue light to tell you it’s getting power. The USB3 cable is thick so I feel it’s not going to be easily broken or crimped. The USB3 cable is not too long nor too short; it’s about a foot long.It’s also hot-swappable; you can connect the Sabrent and a display to it live, no need to power down first.It’s performance also gets a big thumb’s up from me. I plugged two 4K displays into my MacBook Pro and the video and frame rate on each was perfect. I ran an animation tests and on both simultaneously and the adapter passed both displays the 4K images without any issues.If you want a good, solid well-made dual 4K adapter that only uses one Thunderbolt 3 port then this is a perfect device to add to your laptop or desktop Mac or Windows system that supports Thunderbolt 3 and Dual 4K displays.',\n",

We connected the Mac to 2 32\" TVs, such that with the laptop and TVs, we had 3 screens going.  When you initially plug into the device, it goes straight into extended mode (3 different screens), but you can easily switch to mirror mode if you want all the screens to be the same.It does not matter which port the device is plugged in to, and it has a nice, slim plug (it won\\'t block you other ports!!).  The cable for the Sabrent is about 1.5\\' long, which is adequate without being too long.  It does not require a power adapter.  It also has nice rubber feet on the bottom to keep it fixed to your desk.It remained cool after quite a long use, so overheating doesn\\'t appear to be a problem.  You can only output sound to one screen, but I\\'m not sure why you\\'d want more.  This is definitely a useful tool if you find that you often need multiple screens.',\n",

Surprisingly, the block where the Displayport cable attaches is metal and pleasantly heavy duty.  For Windows 10, it requires no drivers, which is always nice.

The adapter plays well with extended displays, duplicating displays, and only using the external display.While I usually run at native resolution, it appeared that all the other resolutions of the external display are available through this adapter too.

I then take it with me to another home I have in another country and set it up the exact same way, But all I can get is a duplicate of the main screen! I finally figured out that the reason why it worked at my first home was because my monitors are different in make and model. However, in my second home the two monitors are identical! So beware, this will not give you two different resolutions unless u have two different monitors! Thank heavens I was able to use the thunderbolt for one monitor and the other monitor I plugged directly into the computer HDMI outlet and it worked great! All this after a computer guy told me what I needed was an HDMI splitter, but I bought a 2 in 1 out splitter so a second conputer guy told me I needed a 1 in 2 out splitter, neither of which did anything but give me a duplicate of my main screen. Hundreds of dollars later and figuring it out myself this is the outcome. Just beware this works as advertised IF u use two DIFFERENT monitors!',\n",

The older StarTech USB32DP24K60 (60hz adapter) did ok and was 60hz but it just couldn\\'t keep up with window movements so if I dragged a window across an external monitor over the adapter it would lag behind what my mouse was actually doing. This new StarTech Thunderbolt adapter connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on both my Dell 2-1 5290 and my 2018 Macbook pro (in both Mojave and Win10 Bootcamp) works PERFECTLY! No lag, just smooth external monitors. This adapter replaced a Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 eGPU dock at work completely, such that I can take the eGPU home and use it for gaming now.Also to note, the Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 eGPU does not work in MacOS because there\\'s no Mac driver/support for nVidia or the protocol the DisplayPorts on the back use. However, if you manually point the \"Generic Windows Display Device\" in Device Manager from Windows 10 in Bootcamp to the nVidia driver folder manually it picks right up and works great. This requires downloading the nVidia driver and going half-way through the install before it fails saying there\\'s no nVidia in your system. This loads the folder on the C drive which can then be pointed to for manual driver install in the Device Manager. In case any of you were wondering.Back on topic: The Thunderbolt 3 StarTech dual-DisplayPort adapter works perfect. 60hz on two 4K monitors with snappy refresh when moving applications around the external screens.',\n",
       "    \"This seems like a rubber-stamp product so the purchase comes down to expected service quality for me and StarTech is a brand that's never done me wrong and even saved my life one time over a decade ago. I'm doing dual 4k output with this baby at 60hz so that's that. It blinks about once a week but doesn't give me much trouble. I'd recommend this thing if you've got an XPS15 9550 and DisplayPort displays. If you've got one HDMI display, be sure to pick up an active DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 adapter. High def dongle life.\",\n",
       "    'All-I can confirm this works flawlessly with the rMBP 15\" with Touchbar and Thunderbolt 3! If you\\'re hesitant with any other products out there with native dual DVI, this is the piece to get: combined with a simple USB-C hub on the other side that supports pass-through charging, I\\'m driving the UP2715K at 5K and 60hz and editing like a dream.',\n",
       "    'I really like StarTech stuff overall, they have a great lineup of converters and cables that I haven’t been able to find elsewhere.

I have sent two support requests to Kensington who doesn't even acknowledge me which is likely due to the pandemic, but to warn fellow users the computer will not restart with the dock plugged in, rather it shuts down and will not restart back up until you hold the power button down for 15 seconds and then click it once more quickly and it starts up. This is major wear and tear on the button and sometimes when everything starts back up, I have to completely reconfigure my monitors as it erases my settings. Don't get this dock until they have squashed these bad bugs.\",\n",
       "    \"I tried upgrading from a SD5000T mainly to get the full-speed 96W charging, and to get both of my displays plugged into an integrated dock rather than needing an additional thunderbolt dongle. Sadly, even after one night of usage, my macbook would crash *constantly* when attached to this dock; when plugging in, when unplugging, when waking from sleep.  Even when it's not crashing my displays fail to light up about half of the time.Not going all the way down to 1 star here because this is almost certainly a software problem on Apple's end (the culprit, if you care about this sort of thing, is a double-free in the AMD radeon kext, which is reliably visible in the panic backtrace), but Kensington should have taken more care to actually test this against real devices before shipping it.I have not returned it yet but I plan to do so within the next day or two unless Kensington's support can work some kind of miracle; the tweaks they have suggested so far have made no difference.Update: I upgraded to Big Sur which some friends had suggested to me might contain some thunderbolt bugfixes, but it's no help. Kensington's support never returned my calls. Big disappointment; I've returned the dock now.\",\n",
       "    \"Since buying a MacBook pro last year, I have had trouble finding a device that will let me add 2 continuous monitors, have USB ports, have an ethernet port, and charges my computer so all I have do do is plug one thing in and go.  I tried many other items that cost around $100 like a j5.  Nothing worked.  My last device kept causing my computer to crash.  I thought it was the computer and found out it was the device drivers.  After updating to Catalina, the device didn't work and the company states it is working on drivers.  This device just works.  You pug it in and it works.  No downloading and installing drivers.  It comes with everything you need for two monitors via HDMI, has plenty of USB ports and has it's own charging system so you don't need to use the adapter that came with the device. (if your device supports thunderbolt).  Yes it is on the expensive side but again, it works.  It doesn't run hot like the other devices do . I was afraid to plug in my flash drive in fear it would damage the electronics because it was so hot.  It even has audio ports and a SD card slot.  It truly is a one shoe fits all device.  Mac's are quirky with third party items but this functions as though it was made by apple.  When you wake the computer form sleep, it takes a few seconds, sometimes 20 or more, for all the monitors to capture a signal so be patient.  I wish I purchased this last year and didn't waste my money on the other useless products out there.\",\n",
       "    \"The Kensington SD5300T dock offers more USB 2/3 ports than I'll ever need.  I bought this to use with my new Macbook Air and it's meeting my needs.  The included power supply allows me to leave my charger and cable elsewhere.  I would have liked to see an included USB-C to VGA adapter instead of the USB-C to HDMI that comes with it.  What sold me on this unit is the length of the Thunderbolt 3  connection cable.  It allows the dock to be placed away from the laptop and not take up valuable desk space.  Overall a good dock at an acceptable price.  Over the past few days I've come across a number of very similar looking docks.  This is the only one I recall offering the extra usb-c to hdmi adapter.  This dock also seems to have brought back to life a usb 3 drive that wasn't responding to my mac mini.  Overall, it has exceeded my expectations.\",\n",

Then when I was confused, I saw an answer from Kensington USA on this page:\"...Thunderbolt 3 laptops will work with USB-C docks (at USB-C speeds), but USB-C laptops generally don\\'t work with Thunderbolt 3 docks. We do have one TB3 dock which is indeed backwards compatible with USB-C, our SD5500T.

       "    \"I feel like this product did a really good job while I could use it.  I ran into a problem that's entirely Apple's fault - my MacBook just so happens to be the one model out of that entire year that can't do Thunderbolt.  If you don't have Thunderbolt explicitly stated on your MacBook specs, this will appear to work for a minute and then bomb out with a 'Thunderbolt is not supported on this Mac' message.That said, on a Thunderbolt connection it does exactly what it says it will do.  It's easy to set up, you get tons of connectors and good instructions, and given Apple's recent tendency to cut back on available ports on a MacBook, it's extremely useful to have multiple USB and video out ports.It's just a lot more expensive than most solutions.  I've used a QGeeM that does most of this and is a lot less, it just doesn't have its own power source but it's only got 7 ports.If you need a lot of ports and you'd like to hook up external monitors to your MacBook (and you absolutely have Thunderbolt and not 'pretend Thunderbolt over USB-C that doesn't actually work') then this is a really good product.\",\n",

The dock connects to an LG 34UM58P monitor via HDMI, an Ethernet cable, and a bunch of USB devices, including three connected through a 4-port hub. An audio system is connected to the headphone jack. Everything worked perfectly from the moment I plugged it in. I wish the dock had its own power button, but I am happy to find one that works.',\n",

I still can\\'t figure out the difference between the 5300 and 5350 and which to get. the agents aren\\'t knowledgable on chat and a week later I still haven\\'t had my email answered. its very unclear what the pricing should be. dealing with them is the sole reason for \\'4\\' and not \\'5\\' star review and my biggest hesitancy in recommending the company- the dock does not function as a platform for the laptop, they need separate real estate on your desk/tableIn sum: if the price stays $200-$230, its a really good value.  If it was $300, I\\'d probably still recommend it, but would be sure to check out Henge and others first.',\n",
       "    'Like a lot of professionals out there, I have two laptops and a wide range of peripherals that need to be connected to my working laptop. I have a Windows based PC I use for work and a MacBook Pro 2020 with Intel silicon for home. I purchased this dock station so I can leave all displays and peripherals connected and switch from one laptop to another by just switching the Thunderbolt cable. Well, with this docking station, this is not possible! Here are some very interesting observations:Observation 1) If I disconnect the dock from MacBook Pro and connect it again to the same laptop, some of the peripherals go offline. I have to power down the dock station, remove all the cables, power it up and connect the cables one at a time. Kensington customer support called it \"Bandwidth Prioritization\" which does not make any sense whatsoever. The most bandwidth hungry peripherals I have are the two monitors which are two exactly the same monitors at HD resolution!Observation 2) Once I get the docking station working again on MacBook Pro, If I disconnect the Thunderbolt cable and connect it to my Windows PC, everything hangs! Not even my laptop works! So, again, I have to disconnect all the cables, wait for 20 seconds and connect them back up one at a time.Observation 3) If the docking station is already connected to the Windows laptop and I reconnect it to the same laptop, I am back to observation 1!I wonder what the purpose of a docking station is, if I have to keep plugging and unplugging all the cables all the time!Observation 4) This device is strangely look very similar to Plugable TBT3-UDZ model. They both have the same specifications. I purchased Plugable dock to see if I get a better luck and I am glad I did. TBT3-UDZ has a bit of issues which is really a Mac OS problem. But other than that, it does everything I wanted Kensington Dock do at lesser price!I contacted Kensington customer support multiple times and went through their troubleshooting process. They insisted unplugging and plugging all cables is expected of this device. Then they sent me to their level 2 support which insisted that I need to replace my HDMI cables with active ones! Even though the requirement for active HDMI cable is when you need more than 10 ft of cable and mine are only 3 ft. Upon further back and forth, they promised to replicate the issue and get back to me. Well, I am still waiting!',\n",

All you need everyday is to connect the usb-c cable to your laptop and you are ready to go.The only cons is it limits to 2 monitors as there is only 1 HDMI and 1 USB-C (to HDMI adapter) ports for connecting monitors, so if someone is looking to connect 3 or more external monitors, this is not suitable for them.',\n",

They emailed me back with a list of things to try. I tried everything that was suggested but it did not fix the problem. So they told me to call them. When I did they told me a few other things to try. I tried those things and then the entire dock stopped working. Technical support said if those things didn't work I should just send it back and that's what I'm going to do. I'm not going to mess with another one, I'll go with a different brand this time.I was very disappointed in technical support. They didn't seem to have a way to get it to work or to verify that there was actually an issue with the doc I received. Their website is not very helpful. After reading the reviews on this product I was pretty excited about it even though it was expensive. I'm very disappointed it didn't work for me.

It is NOT my laptop, its the docking station, specifically the standard size HDMI port.  Without warning the monitor will go dark or the resolution will split.  I've changed out monitors, switched HDMI ports, still the same problem with the identified HDMI port.  Only resolution is to power-off the docking station or unplug & re-insert the HDMI cable.\",\n",

I've been using less expensive hubs, but (1) they get very hot (2) eventually fail and (3) never have enough ports to actually address my needs. I had hoped that I'd find a less expensive solution, but this is definitely a case of getting what you pay for... I have every port on this hub connected with only one exception: the analog audio. It allows me to connect my laptop to the entirety of my studio, and delivers power as well.

Should work for my use case (1 USB and 1 DisplayPort), except that it seems to only handle one of my external monitors most of the time. Sometimes it works with 2, but usually it's some ritual of plugging in, unplugging, chanting, and rain dancing to get this thing to work the way it is supposed to. Most of the time i turn on the computer to a pink screen and a blank second screen and whether or not I get to work on 2 monitors on a particular day is completely up to the docking station. I called customer support as this has been happening since I bought it and they were completely unhelpful. I should have returned it in the return window instead of thinking it would get fixed with a firmware update.2 stars because it almost works.\",\n",

Very too often many products are flooded into the market as a different brands but all have the same origin. Kensington is well known and worked as intended.

My external monitor (connected via hdmi) takes 2 minutes to turn on when the macbook wakes from sleep. I thought the problem was the monitor - a midrange Viewsonic. On a whim, I connected the monitor with the 3-1 usb-c mac adapter. Now it the monitor turns on in 5 seconds from sleep. The problem was the docking station! I spent way too long thinking it was something about the monitor.This is a huge and terrible flaw for a docking station.

It would normally be 5 stars, but my problem was not explained in the instructions.Are you experiencing a problem with kernel_task consuming an excessive amount of power while this is plugged in? Is your laptop so incredibly slow that it eventually shuts off? Maybe you can\\'t get Ethernet to work either? Scroll to the last sentence to fix your problem if this is TL;DR.You probably double-checked and noted that you purchased the \"Laptop Charging\" feature, and it does state that it\\'s supposed to be able to do it. However, the battery slowly drains even though it shows the power charging. Eventually, your macbook restarts.The reason that\\'s happening is that this dock cannot provide enough power on the WRONG USB-C port (the one with one \"Lightning\" icon and nothing else) to charge a Macbook while also providing all of the features it promises in the description, such as dual 4K @ 60Hz, Ethernet, USB, USB-C and others.  Even with a short 40Gb/s USB-C cable, it cannot work. So it just slowly drains your battery while providing everything EXCEPT Ethernet and charging.The reason is that you\\'re plugging the power cord into the wrong slot like me (D\\'oh!).Make sure you\\'re plugging in the USB-C power cord into the USB-C outlet with the Laptop icon! There are two power icons, and one with power and a laptop. Use the one with power and a laptop. That will also fix your Ethernet problem. A true PEBKAC error that could\\'ve been avoided with better instructions and/or design.',\n",
       "    'I am a long time user of the product and I’m writing my review from that point. At first it was a good unit however the second monitor will often turn off if your computer ever goes to sleep longer than 15 minutes. This is very annoying as you have unplug the main thunderbolt 3 cord and re plug it up to regain both monitors again !Then my battery started swelling on a brand new 2018 MacBook Pro ! This is a $300 cost. It has ruined the entire battery on my MacBook Pro. This is why it deserves one star. You guys really need to work out the issues with this device. The monitor issues are just too much and the swollen battery is just a bad icing on the cake for me.',\n",
       "    \"Update after about a week: I gave 2 stars in my original review but I have to drop it to 1 star. The flicker with the DisplayPort is unbearable. I have to jiggle the connection 20+ times throughout the day to make it stop.Original Review:It works fine with my 2018 MacBook Pro. I can extend two monitors, one is 4k, other is 1080p. I use DisplayPort for 4k. Here're some issues:- With DisplayPort, monitor flickers every now end then, and even goes dark for a second or two, and comes back (maybe 3-4 times a day). Very annoying. I tried 4 different cables with the same result. Connecting the monitors to my MacBook directly doesn't cause flickers. So, I'm sure this has something to do with the dock itself.- It doesn't support HDMI to USB-C cable. I have to use my HDMI cable with an additional adapter to connect to this dock.- MacBook's original power cable doesn't work with this dock. It only works for charging. This is very unfortunate because the cable that comes with the dock is very very short. I tried 2 other original Apple cables with the same result. So, if this cable goes bad, I don't even know what to order. A very big issue.- USB-C port in front doesn't work with monitors. I can only use the one at the back.One good thing is you don't need to install any software to make this work. It works out of the box.\",\n",
       "    \"This does a good job at keeping my macbook pro charged when using it, but there are occasions when one of my two screens will just go dark. After it happens a few times I've found that unplugging and plugging it back in will sometimes solve it. The thing that really drives me crazy is when i've been away from my computer and i come back to wake it up. I swear it takes several minutes with both of my screens and laptop screen going off and on, to some beat of music i can't hear, before any of the monitors are useful and i can actually log into my computer. Drives me nuts! That's why i'm giving it three stars.Update:  this product is junk . I've replaced cables on monitors and to the device itself. Note that the cable they ship with the device requires that your laptop be right next to the hub. In order to get my two monitors to work with this POS device, after the monitors stop dancing and one still will still not come up, I then have to plug and unplug cables to try and get it to recognize the monitor. I replaced the cable with a brand new one, so I know that's not the issue. I sometimes even have to reboot my computer. I absolutely hate this thing. I would have returned it, but I had already thrown away all of the boxing materials. I'll probably use it until I throw it out my window, or put it on train track so it suffers as much as I have . Then I will try and find something better. Anything has to be better than this.\",\n",

Ethernet, power, 2 monitors VGA with dongles for the Display Port and the USB Thunderbolt connection, a backup external hard drive.  Set up was easy, hooked everything up and it worked perfectly the first time.  Day one at lunch I had to reboot the computer for some reason, I don't know if it was the dock or something else.  Day 2 no reboots, no issues.  one nice feature is I charged my mouse overnight using the front USB port.  I just need to remember to unmount the external drive if I unhook the computer.  Great so far.  I don't expect any issue.\",\n",

I have to unplug both monitors from the dock, and plug them back in (thunderbolt first) to get the monitors to work.  It's harder than it used to be before I dropped $300 on a dock.I spent about 3 hours with tech support, confirming that everything was up to date and functional, before giving up.  Huge waste of time and money.\",\n",
       "    'I recently purchased a 2017 15\" MacBook Pro with Touchbar. I previously had an Elgato Thunderbolt 2 dock with my old Late 2013 15\" Retina MacBook Pro so I wanted to try another brand. I also wanted Power Delivery for the new Mac as well. This seemed to fit the bill just fine. Has just about all of the ports you could need for a dock. I wish it had more USB ports, but I have a Pluggable USB 3.0 7 port hub to take care of any legacy devices I have (external drives, Snowball Blue Mic, Flash drives etc.)I connected my Dell 4K monitor to the dock with my existing Displayport to MiniDisplay port cable. Went from the Mini Displayport on back of my Dell monitor to the Displayport on the dock. On my old MacBook, I connected it the opposite way. (Displayport on the monitor to Mini Displayport on the MacBook). Upon connection to the dock, my monitor started flickering constantly. I did some digging on their website and found out my monitor (Dell P2715Q 4K) isn\\'t compatible with 4K @ 60hz. Only 30hz. They mention it towards the bottom of their product page at Startech.--Certain monitors may be limited to 4K at 30Hz when connecting through DisplayPort. These monitors include the following models: Dell P2715Q, Viewsonic VX2475Smhl-4K, Philips 288P6LJEB, LG 31MU97C-B, Asus PB287Q (these models will need to be set to 4K at 30Hz).So at the moment, I am using the provided Displayport to USB-C cable they had in the box. Otherwise, I would need to order one outside of this. Power Delivery works awesome. Getting full 85W charging just like the original. Very nice to have only one cord now plugged in. I may consider going with another monitor going forward, but for now, everything works. It seems like similar models from Belkin and a few others have similar results with this particular Dell Monitor.',\n",

This is for my 2017 MacBook Pro and I was suffering from dongle overload and lack of needed ports.  This solved all my problems with just one purchase.  And if you consider the cost of multiple dongles to do the same job you aren't spending that much more for this sweet little dock.Current configuration: 1 DVI monitor, All USB-3 ports in use, all USB-C ports in use, Ethernet, 2 external drives, and Audio Out.Everything functions as it should - no complaints.  Some people made a big deal out of lack of SD and MicroSD slots but no bother for me -- I already have a mini-dock for that which just hooks up to this one.  It comes with a USB-C to HDMI cable, which I used for awhile and it worked fine.  But I swapped it out for a DP to DP cable (my monitor supports both) to free up a USB-C port on this box.  So I'm using all ports and couldn't be happier.UPDATE 1/21/17After using this dock for a while longer I have a few caveats to share.  First, When my machine sleeps (or powers down the monitor for sleep mode) sometimes will not wake up the screen.  I have to disconnect and reconnect the DP cable.  This may be related to my monitor, I can't be sure yet.  But it is an annoyance that didn't happen when direct connected to my laptop.Second, don't chain high-speed devices.  I have a USB-3 port replicator with SD card slots attached to one of the USB-3 ports on the Startech.  It didn't like when I tried to plug in a USB-3 BluRay drive - kept timing out.  But when connected directly to the Startech it worked fine.  So chaining USB block devices isn't recommended.Otherwise still working great.\",\n",

This docking station does the trick, though at a premium price.  While the Dell Dock is more broadly useful in a mixed-electronics-age environment, this startech is decidedly embracing the present.  Definitely more Apple oriented than PC, with a limited amount of laptops able to tap into USB-C (why oh why did Microsoft leave it out of its otherwise wonderful Surface Laptop?!).Comes with all the necessary cables. Just make sure you're able to plug them into what you have, requiring Thunderbolt/USB-C and displayport. It also has 2 USB-3 ports, for data and charging and such. The front has one USB-C and one USB-3 input, with everything else on the back, including microphone and headphone jacks. Worked fine for me and does not seem to have any problems so far.  It does what it says it will do, and that's what I need from it, giving me very high resolution screens to make the most of my laptops power.My only complaints are that I'd like the headphone jack on the front, but that's a creative difference more than a complaint, and it's pretty pricey in comparison to other docks, adding a surprising amount more for laptop charging ability.

It has only one Displayport port, but it also comes with an additional USB-C to Displayport cable. I was able to drive two Dell 4k monitors at 60hz via a 2017 15” MacBook Pro with this setup, but only after checking the troubleshooting FAQ and setting the monitor to the correct DP spec.2) It has 1/8” audio in and out jacks, which the MacOS system recognizes as a separate audio interface. I have never seen another USB-C hub that does this, and this minor but unique benefit may be the only thing keeping me from dropping my review to just one star.3) At least the Ethernet and USB ports work like they're supposed to.That's it for the Pros.  Here are the Cons, and there are more of them:1) It’s ugly and inelegantly designed, two cardinal sins in a product obviously directed towards a very artist- and designer-heavy target market, i.e., people who actually need and use a dual 4k monitor setup. For example, the power supply is as large is the unit itself, and the port placement seems devoid of rhyme or reason - shouldn't the host computer input port be on the other side from the output ports?2) There aren’t enough USB ports. I’ve seen vastly smaller units that have 5+. Why is this unit so stingy with them? A standard setup (keyboard, mouse, external drive, tablet) is unworkable with this unit without purchasing a second unit for USB peripherals.3) There’s no SD card reader.  Yes, people still use those.4) There are no lights on the unit to signify power, connection, ethernet activity, etc. Nothing. This makes troubleshooting the unit - and Startech must know it needs a lot of troubleshooting - even more difficult than it already is.5) It gets VERY hot, VERY quickly.Verdict: Two stars, for being able to perform as advertised, albeit after some troubleshooting and fumbling with monitor settings, and for that unique dual headphone jack port setup. Nothing else about this unit is compelling enough to be worth the hassles and it’s priced way outside the line of decency for something this mediocre.\",\n",

Only having USB-C connections on the laptop does get to be a little cumbersome at times, but when I'm stationary at my desk, using a docking station like this is ideal. This docking station very similar to other brands I've seen, but it has some slight drawbacks to it. While it has a great number of ports for connectivity, it lacks an SD/Micro SD card slot. To me, this is sort of a deal breaker since I use them so much. This is actually the main reason I docked a star from the rating. The docking station works fine, but I felt that there not being a slot for the SD card was a huge misstep in the design. In addition to that, I think it's slightly overpriced. If I were to compare this directly to another docking station the biggest difference between the two is that the other model has 3 USB 3.0 ports and 2 USB-C ports, while this one has 3 USB-C ports and only 2 USB 3.0 ports. I guess it's sort of a toss up based off of your usage on which docking station works best for you.

I also dual boot into windows 10 quite frequency. I needed something that works well on both operating systems which is actually quite tough. I had a pile of adapters and cords to get me through my day. One that was a ethernet/USB combo and several video adapters(I have three monitors) and power in. This previous setup consumed all of my MacBook’s ports and gave me a daily frustration. After the windows 10 fall creators update dropped, I would frequently run into display drops. It got to the point where I would spend the first 15-30 minutes every day just trying to get the computer happy. In mac OS, I would also get cryptic OS crashes when shutting the machine down.Enter the dock, once in, it replaced all of the adapters. First, it provides 85 watts power, a boon for me as now I can keep my power adapter stowed in my bag for travel. Second, it bundles in a hand full of USB\\'s. I daisy chained all my monitor’s USB ports together into the USB port on the back and now can access up to 12 devices. A point which can\\'t be understated, the ethernet on this dock is an intel 12xx series. Most of all of the type c accessories come with some crappy no name ethernet adapter which either doesn\\'t work out of the box in mac OS or doesn’t work in Windows. Not only does it work, but it works well. I can safely recommend this on that point alone. No non-thunderbolt dock will come with a NIC that good. Lastly, it has two full display port 1.2 connections. One via the full-sized DP connection and one via additional thunderbolt 3 connection. I use these connections to get 3 monitors into the dock. One monitor is connected to the other via DP daisy chaining and the others are plugged into the dock. Viola, full desktop setup, including ethernet, 3 monitors, keyboard mouse, and other accessories with one single connection. I also have a set of speakers plugged in, I don’t really use them much so I can’t attest to the quality of that piece.So final thoughts, I begged my company to buy this which was very difficult. They don’t know how much time I save with this thing. It sounds crazy, but it saves a lot of time every day and my sanity. It also works better than any previous setup for hot plugging. In past setups/computer something would go awry if I left the desk and came back. I can report this dock works very well hot plugging in mac OS and Windows. In short, if your situation sounds like mine you won’t regret this. I would recommend this dock to anyone and in particular Star tech which seems to make decent quality kit based on this. I have not tested any other thunderbolt 3 docks so I don’t know how well it stacks up to them.',\n",
       "    \"Startech's compact dock will power your laptop, drive 2 monitors, fast charge through the front USB panel and drive USB peripherals.  Being able to drive an external monitor (or 2), is absolutely critical for most of the modern offices. Alas, our laptops will not do it alone.  Startech provides an easy way to plug and attach your peripherals.\",\n",
       "    \"Given how finicky Thunderbolt 3 docks seem to be, it was tricky to try and pick one that actually worked. I was very relieved to see that this would drive two 4K monitors at 60 Hz on my Dell XPS 13 9360 running Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (4.13 HWE kernel). I used a standard DP cable plus the included Thunderbolt to DP adapter, so both monitors are working out of the box (saves the hassle and $$ of buying an additional cable).When I initially plugged the dock in, it seemed like USB, Ethernet, and audio all didn't work. I discovered that this was because of the default Thunderbolt 3 security settings on my laptop, which required User Authorization. This causes a popup on Windows to confirm with the user, but there is no such interface in Linux so only the displays worked. Once I set the BIOS Thunderbolt settings to 'no security' everything worked - although my laptop is now more vulnerable to malicious Thunderbolt devices. I suppose it will need to stay this way until Linux has an easier way to authorize TB3 devices.The only annoying issue with the dock is that there are only 2 USB ports: what were they thinking? However, alternative docks all seemed more janky so I bit the bullet here. This one seemed most likely to support Dual 4k@60Hz and also came with a cable for the second monitor.\",\n",
       "    \"Worked well. Made my new Macbook Pro somewhat useful. (I could rant about how stupid Apple's design of Macbook Pro was, but I won't)Anyways, this works great. I only attached one monitor but I do audio recording so having the audio in is important. That all worked awesome. As did the ethernet port. So a very effective solution for making a MacBook Pro useful without a fistful of dongles.One note, the 170w power supply won't work on most airplanes, so don't be tempted to forgo the dongles and just bring this. You still need to buy all the dongles if you travel.\",\n",
       "    \"This is a very good docking station. Works fine with my 2017 macbook pro and Dell 5520 Precision laptops.  Powers my macbook as well. Only removing one start because the cable isn't long enough.\",\n",
       "    'This dock has almost all of the ports you’d want. Dual 4K monitors, power delivery, checks almost all the boxes. Why it loses 1 star is the lack of a card reader. And it loses that star because a dock should be a sort of “make it a desktop.” And having to have a dongle takes away from that. But there are enough ports that you shouldn’t have to worry about 1 being used for a card reader. If I could only dock it half a star instead of a full I would.',\n",
       "    'This dock works well (can drive two 4k displays via displayport), for example, two 27\" monitors. But it\\'s ugly, clunky, expensive, runs hot, and would be better with an extra USB port. The 1/8 headphone/mic ports are welcome. If you are more about function, and don\\'t care about looks (or this is under your desk, for example, this is a fine buy.',\n",
       "    \"I'd really classify this more of a multi display dock than a 'docking station.  It really sells on the amount/quality of monitors that it can support (3x 4K UHD monitors).I couldn't really use it because I learned that my laptop doesn't have a Thunderbolt 3 port.  I mistakenly figured it would work with a USB-C connection, but apparently a Thunderbolt 3 device will not work with a USB-C only port.  The port must be classified as Thunderbolt 3 to work.  I was hoping that at WORST, it would be compatible with fewer features (slower speeds and lower power) than standard USB-C ports.  But no: it wouldn't work at all.  Furthermore, I couldn't figure out why it would come with a Displayport, and also include a Displayport-to-Thunderbolt 3 cable.  Why wouldn't it be a Displayport-to-DVI cable?  There are already 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports for displays, i figured the Displayport would allow you to connect to a DVI monitor (which i still consider to be pretty standard in monitors).  Granted, you can buy your own Displayport > DVI cable, but I just don't see the point of the one they provided.As for being a 'dock'.  It really only has 3 other ports other than the ones intended for displays: 2x USB 3.0 ports, and 1x Thunderbolt 3, along with a Gigabit LAN port.\",\n",
       "    'Works great with my MacBook Pro. no issue and works as expected. Shipping was fast as well.',\n",
       "    'Despite what these reviews say, the TB3DK2DPW does not work with Macbook Pros. Nothing more needs to be said it simply is not supported by apple. Heck you for lying to use.',\n",
       "    'Working great for me so far!  Make sure your devices are compatible - this device uses a Thunderbolt 3 (included).  Pretty easy setup, good instructions and demos online.Highly recommended!',\n",
       "    'The Thunderbolt 3 dock  is trim with numerous ports. However the Dock only powers to 60 Watts and my MacBook Pro 15\" requires 87 watts power..There is nothing in the information put forth by OWC that cautions this dock will not charge the laptop as quickly as the Apple supplied power cord.I am returning my drive to OWC this week as I the USB-3 ports on the dock are not sufficiently powerful to charge my iPhone and I periodically get warning messages that the Dock is using too much power (this, despite installing USB related software for the dock as  directed by OWC support technician. I have to wonder if this all related to the fact that it is a 60 Watt power device but my laptop requires a more powerful deviceI have always trusted the OWC name but I wonder if this time my purchase was unwise.'],\n",

So I have to reach behind the doc and unplug it, and then wait for the monitors to get discovered by the Mac, maybe 30 seconds.  I wish it just had two HDMI outputs and that they both worked reliably.I also wish the front of it was covered with old style USB receptacles, because as you can see in the picture I had to buy an amazon basics 7 plug USB hub (highly recommended).Given that the dock has a display port issue, I wish it had a power switch on the front so that I could reboot it more easily.I didn\\'t find a good quality alternative from a known company (I am unwilling to send data through a hub from a no-name company, that could be full of spyware).

When I put my Mac to sleep, sometimes I'll come back and the screens simply won't come on, completely unresponsive. If I disconnect the dock and wait a minute, the Mac's native screen works again. This behavior never happens when not connected to this dock. Similarly, occasionally my Mac won't recognize the dock's connected audio, forcing a restart. I'm looking for a new dock now.Original Review, mid 2018:Just got a brand-spankin' new Macbook Pro 2018 with all the trimmings. This little dock works like a champ - plugged it in, plugged in my two 4k screens, wired ethernet, legacy USB 3 hub with a bunch of accessories hanging off it. This hub _just works_ as the kids say. Competitors' hubs don't provide charge for a 15 inch MBP, this one does. Others look weird, this one looks great on my walnut desk. Money well spent.\",\n",

Everything functions properly with the exception of the power delivery/charging over the TB cable. The 5530 uses a 180 Watt power adapter and the Kensington dock is rated @ 85 Watts. Not a big deal for me, as I was aware of the charging limitation before my purchase. The Kensington TB3 dock wasn't loaded with Vine reviews, which is primarily why I purchased this over other models.\",\n",

       "    \"This is a very buggy product. I bought it so that I can use one TB dock for my thunderbolt-enabled PC as well as my Macbook Pro. However, on the PC, no USB peripherals plugged into the dock work unless they're all plugged in when the computer is booted, and on OSX, it takes many attempts to even get the computer to recognize the dock and switch over the monitor, not super convenient for clamshell operation. At this rate, I'm better dropping thunderbolt entirely and buying a much cheaper USB-C hub, especially since TB3 eGPUs and monitors don't seem to work with this product either. Only seems useful for Thunderbolt 3 HDD arrays.I will say, however, when the product finally works, it is operational in all capacities - just without any of the convenience that I expected from a docking solution.\",\n",

Discrete graphics (R555 in my case) runs both monitors very smoothly.  Sleep/wake behavior in MacOS is flawless. Sleep/wake in bootcamp windows 10 is problematic.

       "   'content': [\"I bought this dock instead of the Thunderbolt 3 Express (which Apple recommends) since I thought having the extra USB ports would be nice.  Upon installing the dock, I started having problems with my internet connection only to find that my router's WAN connection was being dropped whenever the MacBook Pro would go to sleep.  Furthermore, video would not sync properly sometimes forcing me to disconnect and reconnect the cable from the Mac to get it going again.  Belkin tech support was less than helpful and kicked me back to Apple. These docks don't have a HUD either, so there is no way to tweak any settings or install new firmware AFAIK.  I called Apple, and after trying a few things they recommended re-installing the OS.  I didn't feel like doing that so I ordered a Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock.  All of the problems went away after installing the Express dock.  The only reason I gave this product 2 stars is because it did work flawlessly with my Alienware 17R4 laptop.\",\n",
       "    'Before buying this, my normal setup is a Macbook Pro  15\" (2017) connected to a LG 38UC99 monitor, which powers the Macbook and runs the display.  I already had USB hubs and adapters for memory cards, but figured it would be nice to have one device do it all.This Belkin device is either defective or it\\'s not compatible with Macbook Pros.  Wish I\\'d read the review about the 2016 Macbook Pro before ordering.  I\\'m returning mine because:1- It doesn\\'t charge my Macbook when connected.  That completely defeats the purpose of it.  This is without anything else connected!!  I have the latest macOS installed, and my Macbook charges fine through my LG monitor, so it\\'s not like it\\'s a Macbook issue.2- The cable that comes with it is super finnicky.  I had it connected and then it just gets disconnected randomly, and I have to try various ports on my laptop to get it to work again.3- The 4 USB ports on the back are slow!!!!  These cannot be USB-3.0, no way.  They charge slower than any USB I have ever tried!  Again, I am assuming I just got a defective product, otherwise, this is horrible.  I have other USB hubs/chargers bought from Amazon that are not Belkin, but just other brands, and they are much faster even with USB-2.0.  I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with this.4- It overheats when connecting to my Macbook and LG monitor.  I regularly got dialogs on my Macbook saying the hub is overheating and needs to be disconnected - maybe that\\'s why the cable would randomly disconnect?  Not sure, but either way, I think it\\'s dangerous how hot it gets, and seems like they really didn\\'t think some things through.tldr; it doesn\\'t do what it claims, even the USB ports are horrible.  may be defective or may not be compatible with Macbook Pro.',\n",

       "    \"I rarely write reviews, but AFTER I purchased this Belkin dock and ran into problems I stumbled upon one other purchaser who had similar problems and wrote about it. This dock does NOT have a usb-c power throughput power delivery port as do some others. You need to power your mac directly from a power supply into one of the mac's 4 thunderbolt (usb-c) ports. I plugged in 2 HDMI monitors into the Belkin dock (neither of which is 4K), plus an ethernet cable, and I was consuming so much power that the OEM Apple charger would NOT keep my 2017 MacBook Pro charged. My battery was so drained my mac lost all power and I could not recharge and reboot. I had to ship my mac back to Apple. Luckily, my 2017 MacBook was still covered by AppleCare. Apple replaced the logic board (which of course means you get to completely rebuild your mac when its returned), but the problem immediately reoccured.  The only workaround is to invest significantly more money on a newer MacBook pro power adapter (the 2017 comes with a 61 watt power supply. Newer macs have 87 watt and 96 watt supplies). Apple says the higher watt rated supply will not harm your mac, because of over charge protection.  I shelled out $80 more  for a 96 watt power supply and now the battery drain issue is gone. The 61 watt provided Apple power supply is too anemic, although, I did not notice a similar problem when the 2 HDMI monitors and ethernet cable ran directly into my mac, only when run through the Belkin dock. The whole point of a dock is to free up ports on the mac.  So, I'm not necessarily knocking Belkin, who has made some nice peripherals for mac owners, I'm just letting you know you may need more power than what mac shipped with your earlier mac.  Factor in that cost before you buy.\",\n",
       "    'Encountered various problems with the dock, replaced by amazon twice (meaning I am now on 3rd unit). Contacted Belkin support (very professional) and they confirmed a known issue with this type of dock and newer MacBook Pro, in combination with sleep mode. Belkin support stated that there was no firmware update/upgrade path for the unit. Belkin support essentially said that only a newly designed dock may be able to fix it, but there is no ETA for anything. My only options are to return or live with the errors/failures. My choice: ReturnSymptoms:When MacBook Pro wakes up from sleep state, Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro may malfunction. Error symptoms can be frequency issues on monitor connected to USB-C (flicker, etc.), complete loss of signal on Display Port. Only reboot of computer, in combination with possible power cycle of Belkin dock may resolve the issue. Also, while working on MacBook Pro, at random times, the display port may loose signal and may regain if monitor is power cycled and/or display port cable is disconnected/re-connected. But it may not recover and reboot/power cycle may required at that point.The MacBook Pro may experience kernel panics and totally crash when monitor cables are unplugged/re-connected (USB-C and Display Port).The 1st unit I had did not recover from one Display Port failure and the Display Port died completely. The 2nd and 3rd unit behave similar, where reboot/power cycle of Mac and dock usually resolve.I also tested various different video cables and monitors on different ports, different thunderbolt cables (including genuine Apple TB cable) always same/similar results with various failures and/or malfunctions.My setup:I have a MacBook Pro 16\", purchased Nov 2019, macOS 10.15.61 x 4K ViewSonic via USB-C to HDMI direct connected to Mac2 x 2K (2560x1440) monitors (1 with USB-C to HDMI, 1 with straight Display Port)  connected to Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro.Additionally 1 web cam via USB 3, one external SSD (for Time Machine) via USB 3Belkin dock connected on left side of Mac, 4K ViewSonic on right side of MacFindings:Energy Saver settings to Prevent computer from sleeping, with Automatic graphics switching can bring limited stability for several hours and/or work days. Disabling the Automatic graphics switching also yields longer periods without failure.It was not possible to work one full week without issues.

When they come out with a new hardware release then I will try it again. But, until then I will have to try and find a different solution.Since Belkin already knows about this issue, I wish they would publish an advisory on Amazon and everywhere online, so that nobody has to waste as much time as I did during my extensive \"Beta\" tests.It is possible that Apple has some room for improvement as well, because the dock malfunction should not lead to any kernel panic.',\n",
       "    'Long story short: Do not buy. A better long-term investment is a separately powered hub. If you depend 100% on your peripherals, avoid this product at all costs and get a separately powered hub. This purchase was a waste. List money AND productivity. Two external displays and one external 1TB drive resulted in my MacBook taking 10-20-30 minutes to boot up. Unplug the external drive and boot up takes seconds. I have three external drives. I only use one at a time. Boot up is slow no matter what external drive is plugged in. When I had two monitors and two USB drives plugged in, my MacBook would not boot up at all. Apple logo would come up, go away, come up, go away. This went on for 90 minutes. Apple support said the all the peripherals were sucking power from the MacBook. It took 4 hours of problems and Apple phone support to resolve. They said for more than 2 peripherals, get a separately powered hub. I don’t entirely blame Belkin. Apple is mostly to blame. They’re sleek streamlined products just result in bulky, cluttered, hard-to-transport, buy-try-fail extra peripherals.',\n",

Not only does the port just not work at all, it causes my mouse point to sttuter whenever something is plugged in to it. That\\'s on a 2019 MacBook Pro, 15\". It\\'s not the ports on my mac, those work fine if I have an HDMI to USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 adapter on either side (HDMI bus and display link emulation problems), no issues at all.Funny enough, the Thunderbolt port that I could plugin my simple HDMI to Thunderbolt 3 adapter doesn\\'t work when plugged in, even though the HDMI bus isn\\'t in use yet.I\\'m using two HDMI to display link cables.

Issue returns.Went through all possible combinations of cables and monitors, as well as ports on the 15\" of which there are 4, and I ran in to the issue. That\\'s a lot of cases.So, that said, this display link issue has not been fixed, and is a total deal breaker when one of the major selling points of this hub is dual 4k support, and just general dual display link support in general. Even with a single monitor, the issue happens.Belkin, so many people are talking about this issue, why hasn\\'t it been resolved? There are enough 5 star reviews that I had faith in the product, as a lot of times 1 star reviews can be worded poorly and not go in to enough detail, so it just ends up sounding like disgruntled customers.

I have 3 USB-A peripherals plugged into the back of the hub, all of which require full power to run.

I didnt test every port but i did test connecting two monitors, using the SD card slot, using the front usb port and one usb port on the back. I also used the ethernet port. Worked well. It did get a little warm but nothing to worry too much about.The issue i finally noticed after a day was that when i woke up my computer from sleeping, it would turn on but it would not automatically reconnect to the dock. It would wake up on the laptop screen instead of my monitors. The only way i got it to go back to the monitors was by unplugging and plugging the usb c cable. Sometimes I even had to do it a couple of times before the dock finally recognized my computer again. This is pretty annoying since i want a dock that just works.

Each side has some cables coming out. It makes it hart do hid it behind you screen or close to some wall.- power pass-thru somehow registered as only 45W (compared to 60W advertised) with my 61W Apple brick. This may be a design limitation and probably my oversight.- unnecessary audio port. It\\'s surprisingly annoying on Macs because you cannot simply disable it and it gets in the way as selected Audio Out quite often.Ultimately I ended up returning the dock and went with CalDigit Dock Mini DisplayPort version, which has no support for power but fits better my use case',\n",

It worked fine, but I had to cobble it together with more adapters and it didn't have enough ports to support everything. So I decided to spring for the real deal, a proper TB3 hub that would support all of my devices.The good news is, it can drive almost all of those devices, when they can be found. I'm running two monitors, a keyboard, and a mouse off of it currently. The one device it wouldn't support was my webcam. That works fine off of the laptop, but has a flicker when used through this hub.The  bad news is, and this is really a deal breaker, it often fails to detect usb devices (the keyboard and mouse) when I reconnect the computer to the dock (this sometimes happens after the computer goes to sleep as well). This makes me reluctant to disconnect the laptop when the dock is working, which defeats its purpose. Basically I wasted hundreds of dollars on this device. Do yourself a favor, keep looking.\",\n",

This product has so many great reviews out there...  how is it possible I had three bad lemons in a row?!UPDATE: Got tried an entirely different Thunderbolt dock, and the same issue occurred.  However, somehow this other unit was able to trigger the Thunderbolt dock to actually be recognized and approved/installed on the computer, which enabled the rest of the ports to work.

       "    'This is my initial review for the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro, and I\\'ll continue updating it as I use it.Packaging:This Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro was packed in a good, environmental friendly recyclable cardboard box. No styrofoam or clam-shell plastic to fight with. Everything was well packaged, and well organized. In short, Yale has done an excellent job in their packaging. It arrived in perfect condition.In the box:You get the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock, 2.6ft Thunderbolt 3 Cable and 2 instruction manual.Build Quality (Rating 5/5):It feel feels strong and premium, The body is made from what it seems a durable high quality aluminum, with matt gray finish and the front ports are made from black plastic.Design (Rating 5/5):It has a nice visually beautiful black on grey finsh with sleek shape with clean lines, smooth edges and minimalistic design with wide black front and back plastic ports.You get in the front a USB A 3.1 Gen 2, USB C 3.1 Gen 2, Sd card reader and audio in and out. In the back you get, 4x USB A 3.0, gigabyte ethernet, display port 1.4, 2x Thunderbolt 3, DC in 170W.More Info:That dock is a very beautiful and a powerful workstation that utilizes all the benefits of Thunderbolt 3, I use it with my new MacBook Pro 16 inch, as I mostly use my MacBook on the go and at home, and I love that I get to only use one cable for everything, like super-fast data transfer up to 40 Gbps, 4K dual monitor, 85W charging to charge my laptop, and multiple ports to connect my peripherals and network via USB-A 3.1, USB-C, Ethernet, SD and more. The best part is you can connect all this to your Mac\\'s Thunderbolt 3 or regular windows laptop by USB-C and it only requires connecting a single cable, it\\'s insane.This is a no brainer for me, I have 2 monitors and I used to have many cables for the hdmi for each screen and another for the charger and another for the mouse and keyboard, and for the sd card reader and for the ethernet cable as my wifi in my home office signal is very weak. It\\'s really very beautiful just sitting on my desk and it\\'s saved me a ton of accessories and cable management, it can\\'t get better than this, until they invent wireless charging.I\\'ve been using it for a while now, and been running my 2 4k monitors and using my mixer through the audio jack and almost every peripheral is connected and it\\'s running like butter.The Good:- Amazing build quality.- Beautiful Design.- Feels very premium- USB-A 3.1- USB-C 3.1- SD card reader- Audio in/out- 170W PSU (Power Supply Unit)- Thunderbolt 3 (connects to laptop)- Thunderbolt 3 port (connects peripherals)- 1x DisplayPort- GB Ethernet- PowerfulThe Bad:- $299 is highConclusion:Very beautiful, amazing build quality and very powerful dock, very easy to use, everything is just plug and play. I cannot recommend this enough, it\\'s built very well, and feels very premium, it\\'s perfect if you use your laptop a lot.Thanks for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I\\'ve provided makes your decision a little easier.

       "    'I was looking for a DisplayPort based dock because my previous TB3 dock had some issues running HDMI attached monitors that didn\\'t appear when connected using DisplayPort.  The Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus dock has dual DisplayPort outputs at a reasonable price so it appeared to fit the bill.Based on the specs, this dock seems to be based on the newer Intel Titan Ridge TB3 chipset which supports DisplayPort 1.4 and 8k@30hz monitors.  I only have monitors that support 4k@60Hz so I can\\'t test the 8k function.The dock itself was well packaged in a compact box.  Documentation is sparse with only a small flyer describing the ports an the typical FCC/warranty statement.  There were no specifications included.The dock has some nice connectivity features with minimalistic design - Alongside the two full size DisplayPort outputs are an audio jack, three type A USB ports (2x10G and 1x5G), and a pair of 10G USB-C ports, and an ethernet port that seems to be based on the Realtek chipset.The dock supports up to 60W power delivery on the computer port which is located on the front of the unit - Belkin have designed this unit on the assumption that your laptop will sit to the front rather than off to the side.First, ports and connectivity.  There is no TB3 passthrough output.  There are a pair of 10G USB-C ports but these do not support DP alt-mode passthrough so they cannot be used to attach a USB-C monitor.  With this dock you\\'re stuck with the DisplayPort outputs.There are a good number of high speed USB ports but with only three TypeA ports I had to attach a hub to connect all the devices I needed.I have had a number of issues with this dock.First, the supplied cable versus the description.When I ordered the dock the description indicated that it came with a 3ft TB3 cable.  It came with an 18 inch cable instead (the item description has since been corrected).  I contacted support who were friendly but not helpful in the slightest.  Everything has to be \"escalated to management\" who never responds (except apparently to retroactively change the descriptions to match what was actually in the box).  More on this later.Second, I\\'ve had quite a few operational and functionality issues.I needed more TypeA ports than are available on this dock so I had to attach a hub.  One of my monitors has a built-in hub that can has both a USB-C and TypeB input.  The USB-C input worked well with my previous dock so this is the first thing I tried.  However, with this dock the built-in hub was non-functional using the USB-C cable, so I had to burn a TypeA port to use the built-in USB3 hub.Once connected I had odd random issues where attached USB1 devices (such as my keyboard and mouse) would vanish.  Thinking this may be the monitor I moved these devices to a passive USB3 hub which exhibited similar behavior - devices would work for a while but eventually would vanish.  Ultimately I had to attach a separate downstream USB2 hub to get my keyboard/mouse to work reliably.This dock has also been extremely glitchy with my pair of 4k monitors and my 13inch 2018 Macbook Pro running macos Mojave.My LG display has been mainly reliable and comes out of sleep almost immediately, but I have experienced flashing/flickering when attached to the outermost port.  I\\'ve not experienced that issue when this monitor is attached to the centermost port.My Viewsonic Professional monitor (a high-end color accurate 4K display) takes a long time to come out of sleep and sometimes isn\\'t detected at all.  Usually when this happens the monitor doesn\\'t wake up but one time the monitor woke up in mirror mode with the Mac claiming there was no monitor attached.  I had to power down the dock to resolve this issue.  I also had issues with this monitor using the certified DisplayPort cable that was bundled with the monitor - eventually I had to swap this with a short cable to improve stability.Because of the detection and waking issues my Mac frequently interpreted this as display topology changes and would often generate a new display profile and/or desktop arrangement.After much experimentation and troubleshooting I was able to arrive at a combination of cables, port attachment and monitor settings that were mostly reliable.  It was very important that both monitors were configured for DP 1.2 - this dock supports DP 1.4, but doesn\\'t seem to work well with DP 1.1 devices.Although my LG monitor has a setting to enable DP 1.2 mode, my Viewsonic was challenging due to differences between the monitor menus and the manual - the monitor has a setting to \"disable DP 1.1\" whereas the manual claims this setting should be \"enable DP 1.2\".  When set to \"disable DP 1.1\" it takes less time to wake up (still not as fast as the LG) but I\\'ve experienced occasional detection issues in this mode.It\\'s quite possible that behavior will be different with macos Catalina as it likely has updated TB3 and display drivers but I have not yet tested this.Third, technical support.I normally don\\'t review technical support for products because I almost never need to use it.  Because of the cable issue and the problematic operation I contacted technical support several times using the support number included in the package.  Although the support people were friendly the first one I contacted wasn\\'t trained on the product, and none of the support personnel were empowered to do anything except \"escalate issues to management\".  After the first interaction where I was promised a callback from third level support (they never called) the case was closed \"for lack of customer response\".When I called back to reopen the case the second rep was also friendly, again \"escalated to management\", and actually provided a \"still waiting\" update after a couple of days.  That was two weeks ago, and I\\'ve had no updates from them since then.  I assume the case has gone into a black hole.My takeaway is that if you actually need product support you\\'re unlikely to get that from Belkin, whether a simple issue such as \"wrong cable in the box\" or \"product doesn\\'t work properly\".All in all this dock has been significantly more problematic than my older HDMI TB3 dock, but the benefits from DisplayPort outweight the HDMI issues so I\\'m continuing to use it for now.  I will almost certainly be looking for a new dock to replace this one.',\n",
       "    'The Belkin Thunderbolt 3 dock is the perfect dock for a small home office where space is a concern.  The dock works with Mac/Window/Linux/ChromeOS devices as long as they have the supported USB-C port.  I tested a 2018 Macbook Pro (dual boot with Linux Mint), 2018 Asus Chromebook, and a Dell Precision 5530.  Every machine worked perfect except for the Dell, which has larger power requirements than the dock can provide.  This didn’t stop the dock from working, but it causes warnings to pop up.

       "    'The advent of USB-C-only laptops has made the use of a dock pretty much mandatory. This dock provides two HDMI out connections (4k at up to 60 Hz), one USB 3.0 port, one USB 2.0 port, and ethernet port.Typical of a Belkin product, the dock feels very solid, and does not move around a lot when plugged in. It has a compact connector, which is nice because it allows the second Thunderbolt port on the computer to be used concurrently.There are only two shortcomings. First, there is no pass-through power. This is not a deal-killer, as long as your laptop has a second port for power. It seems like a large oversight, however, in a dock with two video ports since it seems likely that driving three displays would drain the battery quickly. My only other complaint is that this is more of a video adapter than a true \"dock,\" since an actual dock would offer more ports and functionality. Nonetheless, it does everything it says it will do, so I did not deduct any stars.Be advised, this is a Thunderbolt 3-only adapter. It will not work as a USB 3.1 to USB 2.0 adapter. This means it will not work with most lower-end PCs or Chromebooks, which greatly limits its versatility.If you want to drive two external monitors at 4k/60Hz, have a thunderbolt port, and don\\'t need power passthrough or a lot of additional functionality, this is a solid choice. The build quality is excellent, and the form factor is just right.',\n",
       "    \"Tested with the Mac Pro (2019) and Apple Pro Display XDR were the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro as well as the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus (this item). The two units are similar in that they both provide compatibility with the Mac OS, and both provide sufficient power pass through to be used as a MacBook Pro power source while simultaneously providing all the desired ports. The BIG difference is that the Pro allows you to connect the Thunderbolt 3 cable directly to the dock from the Mac Pro, and then another USB-C Thunderbolt 3 cable from the dock to the XDR monitor (or similar). The Plus, on the other hand, does not have a USB-C Thunderbolt 3 output, but simply the input which can then be directed to the Displayport outputs. It does, however have two USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 ports as outputs.Let's go through some other differences: the Pro model, which has a retail price about fifty dollars higher than the Plus model, has a metal construction, and weighs about 15 ounces (in case you'll be toting it with your laptop). The Plus is plastic construction and weighs 9.5 ounces. The Pro is thinner and easier to throw in a backpack as a result.Only the Pro model has an SD card reader. The Plus model, on the other hand, has two Displayport outputs while the Pro model has only one. The Pro model has a couple of extra USB-A 3.0 ports (four total) plus a USB-A 3.1 port, while the Plus has 2 USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 ports and 1 USB-A 3.1 Gen 2 port.The Pro has a 170 watt power supply brick, while the Plus has a somewhat lighter 125w power supply. The Pro can deliver up to 85w to a laptop, while the Plus can range up to 60w.Both units are well made, well supported by Belkin, and work as expected. Reading through Belkin's product information on their site will confirm whether you'll have the desired level of performance after all the wires are plugged in. Note that the AC cords for both units are grounded, extend to a separate power brick, with a wire then going from the brick to the dock.\",\n",
       "    'The Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock PLUS is one amazing docking station for laptops. One cord allows you to charge AND use a wide variety of peripherals at the same time. No need for your own power cord since this does it all. NOTE: One item not mentioned, the power cord MUST be hooked up in order use all the features of the dock.Fearures:NOTE: I see some descriptions mention this having a card reader, this one did not.- It has its own power supply connected to a Thunderbolt 3 Type-C port which charges your laptop while you work. (Up to 60W.)- It provides mic and speaker support with an in/out audio port.- It also includes 5-USB ports. (3-USB-A ports and 2-USB-C ports.)- You also get 2-Display ports for HD monitors/displays.- Gigabit Ethernet.On a light note, I’ve included a photo of how ridicules this can get… not something you would want to do, but just to show what this dock is capable of. I had 3 USB hard drives, a USB hub with 2 thumb drives as well as a SD card reader. The hilarious problem I had was keeping track of what was on the desktop and which to eject and from what port. I still had 2 USB-C ports open as well as the 2 display ports and ethernet. All I can say is WOW and remember, this was all on ONE cord, which also was charging my laptop! Very impressive!I have a more traditional 6 port dock that simply plugs into the side but this blew that away when it came to transfer rates. The same 1 gig file was 50% faster than my one year old dock. I will also be testing this with games running from an external HD running Windows 10 under BootCamp and will be posting my impressions. Right now using my old dock, it’s simply too slow and a lot of lag.The only cons on this dock are the high price and bulk of having two peripherals. Most users will opt for something less expensive. However, you will not get close to the versatility or power. With laptops having soldiered in drives, this may be a more viable option than a new computer. As for having two peripherals, one is a power supply replacement and the other provides pretty much everything you need. Not something you would travel with, since it’s more for a stationary desktop use, but it may be worth it since you don’t have to have your original power supply.UPDATE:As mentioned above I was going to try this on a 13” MacBook Pro running the game Destiny 2 under Windows 10 with BootCamp. The results were nothing short of amazing.The previous setup used a traditional dock that plugs into two USB-C ports, to provide 3 USB-3 ports, one for a fast SSD external drive and the other two for the controllers. The game was Destiny 2. Controllers were very slow to almost unresponsive and the frame rate was so slow as to make the game unusable, especially after the recent update. Not to mention the laptop had to use ii’s own charger at all times.New Results- Frame rate highly improved from not being able to play to good.- Controller works perfectly with no issues with responsiveness.- Excellent transfer speed.- All while charging the through the charging port.- Not to mention I still have one of the Mac’s original USB-C ports free.I highly recommend this dock.',\n",
       "    \"USB-C finally managed to become a de-facto standard after Thunderbolt tried to leapfrog USB 3.x and eventually merged with Thunderbolt 3. The smaller size of the USB-C connector enables smaller (thinner) laptops and that's apparently what it's all about, especially for 2-in-1 computers. A side effect is that most devices now end up with USB for everything (monitor, UBS drives, and charging). That's all great but let's face it, most of us have peripherals with older connectors like Ethernet, USB-A or HDMI. (My Lenovo C930) has two USB-C ports and that's pretty much it. Say hello to external docks and dongles.The Belkin dock  takes an USB-C port and breaks it out into two 4k hdmi ports and one for ethernet. It's unclear why Belkin chose to include both USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 outlets, but it's your flavors for the two USB-A ports. There is no external power to the dock (or to charge laptop), which relies on the USB-C port to power the dock. Make sure to have a separate port (whatever the format) to keep the laptop charged for longer meetings, since the Belkin dock does not provide charging power to the host laptop.Overall, the design is okay, even if I am not a fan of the glossy plastic wrapped by a coated aluminum housing. Performance seemed sufficient for my purposes, but I generally don't need gigabit speeds even if they're welcome.The dock is easy to set up, but business users should be aware that Windows 10 with limited user rights will require an admin account to install the dock. Otherwise it will refuse to work, and that could be a big issue if you're on the road (with a customer) and try to use it for the first time.\",\n",

       "    \"This review is for the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus (not the Pro).I knew my husband would want this dock when I saw it, so I requested it. He has been working on and off with the dock for a couple of weeks, he finally was able to tell me about it. After getting a new high-end laptop, he said he was really looking forward to using this dock at his work especially because his laptop has a Thunderbolt 3 port. It does work. However, he spent around 2 hours trying to figure out why he could only get one of the two office monitors to even be recognized by the system. After eliminating one possibility after another, he finally got the second monitor to work only after he used a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter at the docking station. The monitor that's made by Dell worked just fine and the problematic one is made by Lenovo; however, his desktop system has never had any problems with it. Both monitors are a few years old, which may be the biggest part of the problem, but if the dock had reported *something*, it would have made this much simpler. As for the positives, the system automatically recognizes it as a Thunderbolt Dock and Windows launches the Thunderbolt Control Center automatically. It's got great data transfer rates on both the Ethernet port and the USB 3.1 ports. His high-end laptop requires more power than Thunderbolt can deliver but his work-issued Dell business laptop's Thunderbolt port works great and also powers it. If had worked with his monitors that have been reliable, he would have given it an enthusiastic 5 stars; if it had reported that it couldn't work with one of his monitors, he wouldn't have been very annoyed, and he would have given it 4 stars; but since he had the hassle of figuring out that it simply doesn't like one of his monitors, he is giving it 3 stars. Good, but you have to use monitors it likes.\",\n",
       "    'This is a brand I am familiar with and have experienced a consistent level of quality and reliability. I am using this device to replace an existing docking station that did not have Thunderbolt3 capability. The reason I wanted to make the change is because multiple external hard drives connected to my laptop through the old dock were noticeably slow.My previous dock used a standard USB 3.0 connection and the move to Thunderbolt3 increased the speed dramatically. Using crystalDiskMark software, the read speed of the connected hard drive is now 65 percent faster.Setup for Windows 10 is simple--connect all the peripherals to the dock and then connect to a Thunderbolt3 port on a laptop using the included cable. Then Windows 10  displayed a pop up window acknowledging it has detected an attached Thunderbolt device and required permission be granted before loading software and activating the device. Until that action was taken, which took a few seconds, nothing attached to the dock was recognized.The dock has a smaller footprint than my previous device so it requires less space. It also has both USB A and USB C ports along with USB 3.1 both generation 1 and 2. The dock is powered which means all peripherals are on as long as it’s plugged-in, but there is no status indicator light or on/off switch. So, when I remove my laptop from the dock, the only way to power down all the connected peripherals is to unplug the dock.This is inconvenient and because there is no status indicator light it isn’t possible to determine if it’s plugged in or not. Another possible issue is that the dock has no HDMI ports so to connect to some monitors, a display port or a USB device with an adaptor must be used. Five stars for performance but docking a star for lack of helpful user features.',\n",

The body of this dock is solid and has a good weight to it, honestly I thought it’s going to be much lighter.Now let’s discuss the elephant in the room. Considering heavy price tag is it necessary? Well,  I had similar setup without it just not as fast transfer. It wasn’t necessary but it’s so much better.It’s like when you have old computer that is slowing you down but you refuse to get the new one because it’s not necessary and the old one can get the job done. Value for $ is one of my biggest rating points and after carefully considering what we have here I rate this product a 5 stars. It is device that will last long in future, will not need to get replaced until they come up with completely new technology where everything is wireless and we can just go ahead and toss away all and every docking station, USB hub and every similar device.',\n",
       "    \"This dock accepts your regular laptops power supply through USB C and then can provide power to your laptop up to 60w which is more than enough for most laptops other than some recent Macbook Pros which go as high as 90w.On the other hand, if you need to charge this, you can do it in reverse and charge this dock buy supplying power to it using the laptop as the power source. This is the special feature for this dock since you don't need it's own individual power source to send the laptop output to your peripherals.If you are looking at this, you probably know the difference between a regular USB C and a Thunderbolt. The most important factor to me is that Thunderbolt 3 can power a pair of 4K displays at higher refresh rates such as 60hz while a regular USB C maxes out at 30fps.Being a software engineer who has 3 different workstation at home these days with more than 5-6 different displays at time, I am playing with different docking stations and have the chance of testing all of them during these tough work from home Covid times.The Core is relatively small but has a USB A 2.0, a USB A 3.2 Gen 2, a USB C, a DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2, Ethernet and a 3.5 mm audio.Overall for its bus powered internal engine and the features it has specially the nice 60w passthough capacity, this is an excellent dock. It's small footprint and small overall size makes it perfectly portable. Since it's dual powered it is one of the first single cable docking solution that I've seen recently and I love it. The improvements I can think of is getting rid of the USB A 2.0 which is useless these days, adding a few more USB Cs and certainly increasing the 60w wattage to 90w or more. A great start from Belkin for dual powered docks and I'm sure we'll see more.\",\n",
       "    'The Good:-Easy to use dock with Mac or PC-Fast speeds-Compact design-Drives 2 monitors wellThe Bad:-A bit expensive-No HDMI, only DisplayPortThe Bottom Line:I’m using this Belkin Thunderbolt dock at work and it works great. It drives both my dual monitors with no issues. The speed and power power pass through work well. The only thing to keep in mind is that there are no HDMI ports on this dock but has 2 DisplayPort ports. This dock is a bit pricey but it does have a quality build. Overall, I would recommend this Thunderbolt dock if you need to drive dual monitors and want fast data transfer speeds.**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.',\n",

The fact that this is so touchy with respect to USB-C compatibility removes one of the stars. With the right machine, assuming up-to-date firmware, this is a godsend that outperforms most other comparable devices. On the other hand, if your USB-C connection isn\\'t \"up to snuff,\" you\\'ll likely spend hours searching for and (if you\\'re lucky) finding the correct firmware to allow your machine to utilize this device. Working in the computer industry, I know how time consuming and frustrating this can be.

Absolutely demands specific firmware.I do recommend it, but not to people unfamiliar with firmware or the \"not-so-technically\" inclined.Once the correct firmware is installed, I doubt there will be issues, going forward. However, be prepared to have to spend time \"tinkering.\" Also, be aware that this is intended for use with Thunderbolt 3. It\\'s the compatibility with USB-C (more widely adopted) that is an issue, not the performance of the device, itself. I only removed the star because if a manufacturer is going to make a device that is \"compatible\" with other interfaces, it is my opinion that the manufacturer assumes accountability for said compatibility issues, and should be prepared to provide guidance for less experienced users of technology.',\n",

I was able to get 269 Mbps compared to my Uni that maxed out at my top bandwidth of 300 Mbps. Still, very fast.The two USB ports tested at expected speeds using a Samsung SSD and Blackmagic to test the port speeds.I only connected one 4K monitor.

       "    'I love doing tech reviews and if you like looking at reviews before you buy products check me out on my channel \"OndaWire\" over on YouTube and Facebook where I do a lot of video tech reviews. I love Belkin products and I was looking for a Dock that would give me power and the ports that I needed. I saw this Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core and said let\\'s go for it. I\\'ve been testing this out for close to a month and here is my review.Pros:1. For me Belkin is the top-of-the-line resource when I need products. They just produce quality products and this Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core is another example of a great product.2. This dock actually has a USB-A 3.2 port which is the newest USB-A technology from 2019 that allows for transferring up to 20 GB of data a second. That is absolutely insane! YES!!!3. I love the dual monitor 4K@60 GHz. The picture quality is top-notch.4. This Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core is plug and play. You DO NOT have to download drivers or anything. Simply plug it up to any device that is Thunderbolt 3 capable and it will work.***NOTE*** this only works with Thunderbolt 3 devices, so please make sure your device is Thunderbolt 3 before purchasing this.5. I ran Internet speeds utilizing the gigabyte ethernet port and I was over 950 MB consistently every single time. That was awesome!Cons:1. I wish the cord was a little bit longer. It\\'s right at 6.8 inches long and so I had to lower my laptop stand to almost the minimum in order for it to reach the USB-C plug. I added a picture to kind of show what I mean.2. I have a 16\\' 2019 MacBook Pro and the power delivery requires 96 W and this only puts out 60 W. One of the things I noticed while using this is dock is when I am doing a lot of video editing and playbacks the battery tends to drain and not stay fully charged. A couple of times I actually had to unplug my charger and plug it directly into my MacBook.3. I wish on the casing of this dock they would\\'ve labeled which USB-A port is 3.2 and which one is 2.0. I really have no way to tell so I just keep switching between the two.Overall, I really like this Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core. It works exactly how I was expecting it too and I definitely give it a 4.5***** star rating. The super-short cable and 60 W PD is why I did not give this a 5***** star rating.If you are looking for a dock, just remember that this dock only works with devices that have Thunderbolt 3. It will not work on any devices that are not Thunderbolt 3. Even though this did not get a perfect five-star rating I would still highly recommend it if the two or three cons that I listed or not important.',\n",
       "    '[ For the TB 3 Dock Core ]The dock works out of the box without any hitches on my setup. The single upstream port carries video and USB, allowing quick switching between laptop / desktop. However the \"core\" version is severely limited.It is priced similarly to my\\xa0\\n\\nDell WD19\\n\\n  , so I will compare against that.The major difference is of course, this one uses the Thunderbolt 3 technology over the regular type-C of the older one. This allows video passthru at higher rates. For example, I could only get 1440p @ 60 Hz on Dell, but I can get 144 Hz on Belkin. This is a definite plus on Belkin side.The second difference is the power adapters. Dell came with a rather bulky one (at 180W), while Belkin asks to provide your own. And it only supports up to 60W, which is rather limiting for high performance laptops.The bottleneck is the upstream connector. Dell has a rather thicker, and longer one. However Belkin provided a very short and thin cable, which cannot carry more than that.And finally the number of ports is a bit low. There are only two USB ports, and the type-C power port does not seem to pass data. (i.e.: cannot \\'daisy chain\\'). My current setup needs three, and that is something I did not realize before requesting this product. Dell provides three regular USB, and two type-C USB ports, which provided better coverage.Overall if you just need two ports (and no easy future expansion), and 60W would be sufficient, this is an adequate device. If you plan for future expansion, you might want to look at the higher models.',\n",
       "    'I got this for my wife to use with her Dell XPS 15 laptop from work.  It works as expected - connects to the external monitor, Ethernet and audio out.  It is properly detected as a Thunderbolt device.  Although the XPS requires more than 60W, the power from a separate 87W adapter passes through fine.  My wife is not a power user, so her computing activities are never likely to go over that 60W limit.Two minor complaints I have about this:1.  The permanently attached Thunderbolt cable is quite short.  This is fine for on-the-go or temporary docking scenarios, but when leaving it at a desk and connecting the laptop as needed it makes for a sloppy setup.2.  The USB input port is on the side - it should be in the back.  Chances are your power source is going to come from the back of your computing location, and this makes it unsightly and somewhat challenging to route cables.  I know space was limited in this form factor, but this thing is similar in size to an Intel NUC - which is a full computer - and all of its ports manage to be on the back.Overall, for a \"dock on the go\" type of solution, this fits the bill.  But if you\\'re going to leave it in place and connect your laptop as needed, I would look elsewhere.',\n",
       "    'Know up front that this Belkin dock is specifically for Thunderbolt.I have a USB-C type connection on my Dell 5200 2-in-1 work computer that I hooked up to this, hoping to use it for multiple monitors. However, that laptop uses Displayport over USB-C and it is not compatible with this dock.That being said, it works just great with my Macbook Pro 15\" Retina 14,3. External displays, USB devices, gigabit ethernet, no issues. I also didn\\'t have any issue with adequate power delivery (PD). I think that the people that are using the Macbook Pro 13\" may be encountering issues because the stock USB-C power brick for that unit is only 61w; the 15\" uses the 87w brick. The Belkin is only rated to provide PD at 60w, so that may not be enough \"oomph\" for the smaller output power adapter when combined.My only wish is that there was a Displayport over USB-C model available (or that I\\'d paid attention to the logic board specs on the Dell 5200 when I ordered it). For what it\\'s worth, the HP USB-C G5 dock works perfectly with the Dell, although that\\'s a little out of the scope of this review.I did not have to access technical support to use this device. It\\'s driverless and pretty much \"what you see is what you get.\" And if what you need is a Thunderbolt 3 dock that\\'s not the monster that say a Caldigit TB3 is - not to mention its monster price tag - I think you\\'ll be happy with this one.',\n",
       "    'I\\'ve tested out many of these docks at this point in time (especially since the work at home orders) and this dock provides a top tier \"ultimate\" experience for those of us who have laptops that can take advantage of it (more on that in a second).The ability to power multiple monitors (especially a 4k or 5k monitor, or multiple 4k monitors) means that a laptop essentially becomes a desktop.I tested this dock with a few different laptops with varying results.In testing with my Chromebook4 (what I am writing this review from); I was only able to drive one monitor at 1080p (it was showing 4k but didn\\'t seem to want to display, might be due to the chrome OS). The second monitor wouldn\\'t show up but this is a basic chromebook so.... considering the dock costs as much as this laptop; I am not expecting a dual 4k workstation out of it.Secondly I tested it with my GPD Pocket; I was able to get 1 4K monitor at 30hz or two 1080p monitors at 60hz (provided the laptop was closed and the internal monitor was off, otherwise just one monitor worked).Then I tested it with my phone and was able to get 1 monitor working at 4K 60hz (but the scaling was messed up) and other monitor didn\\'t show up at all.Lastly I tested with my Zenbook Pro Duo and I was able to get 2x 4K 60hz monitors working without a problem.I didn\\'t bother testing with my AMD powered Acer Nitro because I know that it doesn\\'t support video output via USB-C and therefore it makes a dock like this kind of useless.With all the laptops I tested I was able to use keyboard and mouse and wired ethernet without a problem (including with my phone) but not all laptops will be able to be powered via USB-C also (zenbook pro duo) so I would have to also use the power brick with that laptop. However with my other 2 laptops it is just a single connection and you get everything at once.If you have a laptop like this (most higher end laptops can do it all); then a dock like this gives you a 1-connection solution for turning your laptop into a desktop. If you haven\\'t used a real keyboard with your laptop then you don\\'t know what you are missing out. The experience is just like that of a high end desktop (provided you have a good keyboard of course) and a dock like this allows you to have just one computer that you can do everything with.The ability to have a 1 wire connection is really what does it for me; of course you can have multiple desktops (I do because I am a developer) but to be able to have a workstation where i can sit down and plug in a laptop and work on it as if its a desktop is a great thing. This dock does cost almost as much as a cheap desktop tower; but you won\\'t get the same performance out of a cheap tower and its yet another computer that you will have to manage. I think that this dock does everything right in the case of what you would want in a high end dock.All in all this is a great dock that just works out of the box as long as you have a laptop that works with it. Just be sure to check for thunderbolt support on your machine before you try to use it. If you don\\'t have thunderbolt support it may still work but have limited function (like my phone or chromebook). If your laptop doesn\\'t support video output via USB-C then this dock isn\\'t for you as that is the main feature of it.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!',\n",
       "    \"This is a very well-made and designed docking station. The one that I have does not have an SD card slot/input as the picture but it does have 2 DisplayPorts, 2 USB-C ports, ethernet (Gigabit), 2 USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3.0 port. There is also a Kensington lock slot (which considering how much this puppy runs, it might be a good idea to use it). My monitors are actually not DisplayPort but I am able to connect to them via an adapter. My monitors are not 4K 60Hz but rather 1080P. Nonetheless, this works very well, my peripherals are VERY much faster than the other dock I was using, and this has made things quite a bit neater. Also, I love the fact I can use it with Windows 10 (as I am now for work) or with a Mac...as I am considering investing in one. The USB-C ports work very well and while the power delivery cannot power my laptop by itself, I am not worried about but rather am focused on the improvement that I have seen with external hard drives and the monitors themselves. I had a much cheaper dock before (in every sense of the word) and I found that my monitors (dual) would sometimes lock up or sort of freeze (force stop maybe?) and it always happened at the most inopportune times...conference calls or video calls...times I was sharing a screen. This is really what I needed all along because I cannot afford to sacrifice speed for economy. For my personal computer, no worries but for work, I must have something that works well and does not impede progress. This dock is it.Setup was fairly simple...One cable going to the dock from the computer and the rest from the dock. My monitors are newer and did not give me any issues.Functionality is great for the monitors and USB ports but I have not tried the ethernet port (so I cannot comment on its efficacy).Pros:Setup is simple if you have ThunderboltCan possibly power your laptop via the power delivery systemHas the capability to do 4K at 60Hz (although I don't know a lot of people with laptops that can power that much for anything game related)Gigabit ethernetMade wellWorks with Windows and MacCons:Is not cheapIs not cheap (listed twice to emphasize the point)Overall, if you require speed and cannot afford to be slowed down at inopportune times (conference calls, collaborations, video conferences), I highly recommend checking something like this out...along with other options and making the decision that fits your situation best. This is definitely an investment and not one to be taken lightly.\",\n",
       "    \"All I want is a dock that requires little to no set-up and just gets the job done and the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Plus gets this job done very very well.From the get-go, it comes in a small, hassle-free cardboard box that opens right up and includes the dock, charging cable and the thunderbolt cable that connects to your laptop (took me about 30 seconds total). All other wires you need to provide yourself. But once I set that up and plugged all my cables in, I had my set-up up and running within a few minutes. Overall the dock is super powerful and the main power source provides enough power to power all the usb outlets (great for portable storage). I use my 2 display ports for dual 4k monitors and running those with my macbook screen open as a third monitor is a breeze. The inclusion of both USB-A and C are inclusions as my keyboard and mouse take up the 2 USB-A slots in the back and the C's are taken up by portable hard drives and a cable for my phones. The final front USB-A is good for jumpdrives.The only reason I docked this 1 star was for an almost $300 dock, I found myself frustrated by the lack of total outlets (2 usb-c in the back + 2 usb-a in the back, and 1 usb-a in the front). Given that most of my outlets are almost always in use, it was slightly annoying to have to unplug one thing in order to plug something else in (like a pair of surround sound usb-headphones). Final slight annoyance is the thunderbolt cable port that connects to your laptop is in the front of the dock, which makes is strange since the cable connects to the side of your laptop. I would have much preferred to have this come out the side.\",\n",

It doesn't really get much better than this. It made up for the loss of my 2 USB's that were blown to bits by another item I was testing and I was happy to have them back and that sealed the deal for me. 4 BIG stars.*If this review helped you make an informed choice about this product in any way I would appreciate it if you take a moment of your time and let me know by hitting the Helpful button and letting me know.

       "    \"I have a tried a lot of docks for my Mac and this is the price range for one with good performance.The first test I perform on these is a the port speed test by comparing the performance of a peripheral connected to the dock against it connected directly to the laptop.My Samsung X5 drive which performs at about 2300 MB/s write and 2800 MB/s read performed at about 92% when connected to this dock via the Thunderbolt 3 port. I use Blackmagic to measure the speedsUsing an external mechanical 7200 RPM drive connected via USB 3.0 performed at about 87%.Another test I perform is to qualitatively test latency with a USB mouse. I put the dongle on the dock and test the mouse reaction. In most docking stations the mouse gets jumping and lacks smooth motion. But with this dock it was perfectly smooth. This indicates there is minimal (or none at all) latency between the port transfers.I was able to test one 4K monitor connected (and was active) while performing all other tests. No issues there.Charging works as expected.I am giving this docking station 4 stars for two reasons:1. The provided Thunderbolt 3 cable used to connect the computer is too short. 2.3 ft seems long, but it really isn't. This is a standard-length cable for most docking devices but there is at least one device on the market that is similar in price, features and performance and it provides a longer cable. I like to have my dock off to the side and out of the way.2. The drive performance takes just a little more of a hit than I think it should.Overall, this is a good dock and probably better than most.\",\n",

The price tag is up there but the Belkin quality is what you get for the $. I am sure prices will start coming down and more and more not so known brands will start coming up with similar products at much lower price too but how long will it last and how will affect your devices remains to be seen.

Luckily my monitor has dual display port inputs because this dock has no HDMI support but does have dual DP.  For my use case, I don't need both DPs on the dock since I'm only hooking up one monitor but dual DP does seem rare and if you want to drive dual monitor from your MacBook this is one of the fewer docks out there that will allow that.  For my use case I would have preferred one HDMI and one DP as HDMI is more common to find as inputs on monitors.  I also have found the network connection to be reliable so I don't have to worry about Wifi when I'm docked.  I also get full power charging to the MacBook.Dislikes:The power brick is huge and the box itself is just cheap plastic.  Since it's somewhat expected to live close to your pretty MacBook, it would have been nice if Belkin would have made the case out of aluminum.

And their Thunderbolt 3 dock doesn't disappoint. First of all, this is a beast. It is absolutely portable, but the form factor is large and heavier that most people would like lugging around in a laptop sleeve. If you are in the market for a Thunderbolt 3 dock, you likely aren't looking to have it with you all the time - like working remotely in a coffee shop or on the train. I use mine primarily in my home office to connect 2 monitors, my laptop, wireless optical mouse and keyboard, and an external hard drive. I keep the cords velcro tied to clean up the mess of having cables run everywhere. And everything fits nicely at the rear of my desk, out of the way of my immediate working area. And there is no noticeable overheating with this dock as some reviewers have mentioned for other manufacturers. All in all this is great doc albeit expensive.

I prefer to be wired in to my network when possible and this dock simplifies things. I leave my monitors and network plugged in to the dock and I just set my laptop down, plug in the Belkin dock and everything works.One bit of advice is to do some checking about what hardware your laptop really has. In my case, the logo on one of my laptops indicated it had a different type of USB-C port than it really has- despite the logos being \"standardized\" in the industry. Some frustration there, but because of the laptop manufacturer and the constantly evolving standards. In the end, this adapter still works on both laptops anyway- but if you have an early USB-C version there may be some limitations. Check carefully.',\n",

Belkin's website suggested that it would work. It works, but with a catch.First, this works flawlessly as a dock with my MacBook. I'm running one 1440p screen with a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapter, and a second 1080p screen with a DisplayPort -> DVI adapter, and a keyboard and mouse running from the USB ports.I connected my old desktop to the dock with a standard USB-C-to-USB-C cable, and it worked as a USB hub for the keyboard/mouse I had attached (no video, I have the desktop connected to separate inputs on the monitor). That worked perfectly, too.I just replaced the desktop with a new desktop, and the dock initially didn't want to behave as a USB hub. It would detect that something was plugged in, but would eventually error out saying there was a problem with the device when connected. I replaced the USB-C-to-USB-C cable I was using with the old desktop with a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C cable, and that seems to work okay. I'm not sure why the new machine wasn't playing nice with the old cable.One small nit - the listing claims the included Thunderbolt cable is 2.6ft, but mine is only 18-inches. The cable is also quite stiff. Unless you've got enough desk space to place your laptop right next to the dock, I'd invest in a longer, braided Thunderbolt cable that you can tuck out of the way.\",\n",

They also do so with a sturdy box that doesn't get dragged around by the innately heavy cables that will inevitably be connected to it.The price is the fly in the ointment.  It's steep.  Some of that is due to the various bits needed to assure a good video signal, provide clean charging and other stuff, but much is the Thunderbolt tax.  Anything with the word Thunderbolt in the description (this can work with some USB C devices) tends to cost much more.  It's largely due to the fact that Thunderbolt has generally been on higher end devices.Anyway, pricing aside, this delivers an amazing video signal, fast ethernet, and charges my laptop all with a single cable.\",\n",

It’s is a little expensive (one may be able to buy a decent computer for that price ;) But it's worth the. Price for at least a Macbook owner (can’t say for Windows because I don’t own one).First off, this dock has a nice feel to it and it's designed to save space and maximize utility. The best part is that it has the most commonly used ports (a headphone jack, USB3, USB-C, and SD card) in the front so that you don’t have to try and reach the back to use these ports. And it has a lot of ports in the back as well to connect multiple devices. It also has an ethernet port for connecting to wired internet.

After getting a gaming laptop recently with USB-C, I've been looking for a dock to get rid of the jumble of cables I have to connect each time I want to work or game (see picture).  The Dell dock that is offered for my laptop had such bad reviews, problems with reliability, that I didn't want the hassle.  I also bought a gaming monitor that supports 165Hz and also upgraded my laptop screen to support 120Hz.  With this higher rate, Display port is the only way to go to support that speed and luckily this dock only has 2 display port slots.  On the other hand, if you're using HDMI, this is not going to be the dock for you without some sort of converter.  Quality is great as is the construction.  It includes a surprisingly short USB-C cable.  Mostly importantly, it worked right out of the box.  I'm pretty technical and the only thing that I haven't encountered before is you need to provide permission for the dock/peripherals to access your computer which was fairly easy - there is a pop-up, go the screen, select allow all access.  Very pleased with lack of clutter and ease of set-up, see after picture.\",\n",

I have become an unwilling connoisseur of hubs and docking stations. This is one of the best I've found that doesn't have its own power supply. With two USB ports I can use keyboard, mouse, and another peripheral. Even though our home has WiFi it's nice that the unit provides decently fast Ethernet capabilities.

It is a solid piece of gear that doesn't move around on the desk by the flex of the cables. It has enough heft and mass of its own combined with rubber feel to stay put. The ports are arranged in a logical layout. It works good in a rear jack with the ports facing to the rear. That way everything stays nice and tidy.

Physically, the hub feels high quality, much better than the sub-$50 dongles all over Amazon.Some people have mentioned USB not working, but that is because in some systems you need to change the Thunderbolt 3 security settings you have in you BIOS for that to work.I was able to get the displays and USB ports to work 100% fine in a Lenovo Carbon X1 v6 using Linux (after a change in the BIOS TB3 security settings) and a Dell XPS 13 9360 using Windows 10 (which worked out of the box).Only thing that would be a noticeable improvement IMO would be for it to have power delivery.Edit: I tried the included ethernet adapter and it works perfectly well.

So kudos to Amazon for taking care of that issue quickly and easily without me having to go back to the manufacturer and returning the hub.

       "    'Edit: Updated from 4 starts to 2 stars due to unreliable (flaky) GigabitEthernet port. On my 360 Mbps Internet connection, SpeedTest shows between 35 Mbps and 360 Mbps. I tested with an Apple Thunderbolt2-to-GigabitEthernet adapter daisy-chained to the Apple Thunderbolt3-to-Thunderbolt2 adapter, and I got consistent download speeds of 350-360 Mbps to the same server on the same Ethernet cable. My conclusion is that the Ethernet port is quite unreliable on this dock. Unplugging and re-plugging the dock into the Thunderbolt3 port on the MacBook Pro fixes the speed issue, but then it recurs. So, I had to return the dock.********************************************************************************************************************************This dock is powered by the USB-C port on the dock from any USB-C power supply. If you monitor has USB-C PD, you can plug it in the USB-C port on the dock. However, be aware that the dock can\\'t send video to the monitor via the USB-C port. The two ports that can send video signal to the monitor are: DP1.4 and HDMI2.0.DP1.4 is a real deal on this dock. If your 5K (or 8K) monitor can receive 5K via one port, and if your MacBook Pro supports DP1.4 in one stream (true only for 15\" and 16\" MacBook Pros since 2018, for 2020 13\" MacBook Air, and for 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with 10th generation CPU), you can connect your monitor to this dock with one DP1.4 cable and send 5K @60Hz to the monitor. The picture is gorgeous. The monitor goes to sleep and wakes up properly while connected to this dock with a DP cable. I haven\\'t tried the HDMI port on this dock.If your laptop is is 2016-2017 15\" MacBook Pro or 2016-2020 13\" MacBook Pro (with the 8th generation CPU), or the 2018-2019 MacBook Air, you can\\'t send 5K out of this dock to the monitor because you need to tile two DP1.2 signal with two DP cables to the monitor, and this dock only has one DP port. The HDMI2.0 port doesn\\'t support 5K (you need HDMI 2.1), so you are stuck with 4K @60Hz if you want to use the HDMI port. Like I mentioned above, the USB-C port on this dock is only for connected a USB-C power source, so you can\\'t send any video to a monitor out of the USB-C port on the dock.The DAC on the dock is decent and very similar to the DAC on the MacBook Pro in the sound quality. The dock\\'s DAC is connected to the computer via the Thunderbolt3 port as a USB2 device. When the external speakers are connected to the headphone jack on the dock they sound very similar to the way the same external speakers sound when connected to the headphone jack on the MacBook Pro.Both USB-A ports on the dock provide USB3 speed. I plugged in a USB3.0 flash drive into each port, and the drive got mounted as a USB3 device on both USB-A ports on the dock.When I connect a 45W USB-C power source to the USB-C port on the dock, it signals 30W to the MacBook Pro (20V x 1.5A). When the same power source is connected directly to a Thunderbolt3 on the MacBook Pro, the power source signals 45W to the MacBook Pro (20V x 2.25A). You can check what your power source signals to your Mac by using the command: \"pmset -g ac\" (without quotes) in macOS Terminal. I don\\'t think this dock consumes 15W of power, but it certainly \"reserves\" 15W for itself and cuts the passthrough power of the external power source by 15W.When I put the MacBook Pro to sleep, the dock remains powered. In other words, the dock doesn\\'t go into the sleep mode, which I think is as downside of the dock.I\\'ve read others complain about the dock getting too hot, but so far for me it\\'s barely warm.Now, instead of my MacBook Pro looking like a spider with cables sticking out of each port, I now have one Thunderbolt3 port with the cable connected to this dock. So, if I need to take my MacBook Pro off my desk, all I have to do is to disconnect one cable.',\n",
       "    \"It is unclear to me why, but as soon as I plug in the dock my laptop (Dell XPS 9310) starts heating up so much that the fans become intolerably loud - even when no monitor is connected or when the dock isn't being used to for powder delivery! This continues even when the laptop is shut. And even though the dock does what it's supposed to, this makes its use very annoying.On a sidenote for people that didn't read all the specs (like me): This does not come with a charger, you will need to purchase a 60+ Watt charger separately.\",\n",

       "    \"This Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro is an excellent solution for today's computers that need docks and dongles for just about everything. I'm using this with a Mac Mini and it works perfectly without any drivers or setup required. A Thunderbolt 3 cable is included, which is part of the reason for the price tag, because quality Thunderbolt cables aren't cheap.The build quality of this is excellent, with a perfectly machined aluminum body and a smooth shiny plastic front/back panel. It's perfectly reliable and has never dropped any connection with the display or peripherals. It has a bunch of useful ports, including an extra Thunderbolt 3 port on the back, a USB-C 3.1 gen 2 port on the front, ethernet, audio in/out, SD card slot, and a bunch of USB 3.0 ports. It has a DisplayPort connector instead of an HDMI port. If your monitor doesn't have a DisplayPort connector, you can always get a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter, or DisplayPort to MiniDisplayPort, or whatever your monitor might need. You can also drive a display from the Thunderbolt or USB-C ports.There's a little light on the front that is orange when the computer is disconnected or asleep, and green as soon as the computer is on and connected. There's no on/off switch on this dock, so if you want to power it off you just have to unplug it. I only unplug it if I'm not going to be using it for an extended period, otherwise I just leave it in standby mode so it's ready to go whenever I turn on my computer.I just got a Dell laptop that runs Windows and has a Thunderbolt 3 port, so I tested this dock out with it and it works perfectly, just like it does with my Mac - the first time I plugged it in, Windows installed some drivers silently in the background and it was up and running in about 10 seconds. The dock charges the laptop at full charging capacity, which is great.Keep in mind this is strictly a Thunderbolt 3 dock - if you don't have a Thunderbolt 3 port on your computer, it won't work. USB-C uses the same connector so it can be confusing. If you don't see a little lightning bolt symbol next to your USB-C port, it's not Thunderbolt. My Dell laptop has one Thunderbolt 3 port and one USB-C port so I have to make sure to plug it into the Thunderbolt 3 port, otherwise it won't work.I love that I can switch this between my Mac and PC, and it lets me use an external monitor and a bunch of other connections. I'm only using one monitor with it right now but it can drive two 4K displays (or one 5K display). If you have a computer with a Thunderbolt 3 port, this Belkin dock is an excellent accessory. Highly recommended.\",\n",

The fact that I maintain transfer speeds of 40Gbps with the Thunderbolt 3 is a life saver, all while charging my MBP 15” with the 85w charger, mirroring it onto my 4K display. I feel like I don’t maximize this dock to it’s fullest potential, simply because my needs are much less than what this dock can do! This is a must have for anyone in videography, cinematography, Photography on a large scale, etc. Anything really focusing on media of the sorts would love this Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock!

       "    \"I just wished I have believed the other negative reviews saying that the second DisplayPort connection didn't work. I thought they were not knowing what they were doing trying wrong cables or having a weak hardware. Those things can totally influence the results. I have a collection of different cables to try and also different monitors and different laptops. I tried all possible combinations to make sure that that port is actually problematic. It is not just one or two units. The second DisplayPort is indeed broken by design. Every single unit is going to behave the same way.I was actually able to make it work but the solution is hacky as hell and defeats the purpose of having a dock station. Here are my findings:All tests have a thunderbolt3 enabled laptop connected to the dock with the provided thunderbolt3 cable at the right port (the one in the front).Test1 with MBP152019 (works)dock connections: one 4k monitor connected to the first DisplayPort (closer to Power connector)---------Test2 with MBP152019  (works)dock connections: one 4k monitor connected to the second DisplayPort---------Test3 with MBP152019  (doesn't work)dock connections: two 4k monitors connected to the DisplayPorts. Second screen is blankSo.. After those 3 simple tests my conclusion was that as the second DisplayPort alone worked perfectly at 60hz, the problem was just happening when both ports were used simultaneously. Then I decided to trick the internal dock board a bit out of curiosity.This is what I did in the following order:1. Disconnect the laptop from the dock2. Connect *just one* 4k monitor to the *second* DisplayPort (the left one looking from behind)3. Connect the laptop to the dock station and the monitor works normally at 60hz4. Connect the other 4k monitor to the *first* DisplayPort (the right one looking from behind)Voila! Everything worked as expected. At this point you have two 4k monitors working independently (no mirror) at 60hz. Of course this defeats the purpose of having a dock if I have to repeat all those steps every time the laptop sleeps.I repeated all the tests described above several times and the result was always the same. This is how I concluded that this model has actually an internal design problem and Im pretty sure that every single unit is going to behave exactly the same way. It is sad because it had a lot of potential! I really wanted to like this model as it had the limit price point I was decided to spend. I returned the unit and payed decided to pay the extra dollar to get the Elgato dock that I already knew it worked. Shame on the engineering team and management behind this project.

I really do not notice it.  Port selection is very good especially if your new laptop does not come with a full SD card slot.  Overall, I am very happy with this docking station.One note on ports, Belkin is not doing themselves a favour by being unclear about the DisplayPort version.  Based on the maximum resolution / refresh rate it has to be a DisplayPort 1.4.  Which you need for a 1440p 144Hz with 10 bit colour depth monitor (ie. HBR3).  Most other docking stations use DisplayPort 1.2.  There are not too many docking stations with a DisplayPort 1.4 or a Titan Ridge TB3 controller.  If you are spending the money on a large fancy monitor, make sure to get the DisplayPort version that matches the one on your monitor or better.For Dell users, The XPS 15 does complain that the charger is 'slow' which is only because it doesn't have Dell's excessive 130W proprietary adapter installed.  85W is more than sufficient and is properly identified as 85W in the BIOS.\",\n",

       "    \"This product is intended to declutter your desk and make your life much easier with a single cable solution. It is very convenient to use, as you only need to plug the single Thunderbolt 3 cable into the compatible device in order to have the various ports available to use on the product. So I would recommend this product for minimalistic and simplistic use-cases. Even I, who doesn't mind the cables and dongles, like to use this product, it is such a convenience.The most important advice I can give you is to check the compatibility, yes theoretically any laptop with Thunderbolt 3 ports should work with this dock, however, by looking at the product page you can find the list of compatible and incompatible laptop models so make sure yours is on it, in case it isn't, contact the manufacturer because this is a very expensive product.Thunderbolt 3 first appeared on the devices in December of 2015 and the new Thunderbolt 4 standard is supposed to be released by late 2020, so if you bought a laptop device during that period you might have this port, it has a small lightning bolt icon next to the USB Type-C port which means that that port supports Thunderbolt.The second most important question is the future-proofing, i.e. how relevant/compatible it will be in the coming years given you have to give so much money for it. The Thunderbolt 4 will probably arrive in late 2020, will use the same port and will most probably be backwards compatible with all of the previous Thunderbolt versions the same way the previous versions have been.Also, the USB 4.0 standard will arrive late 2020 / early 2021 and will have the Thunderbolt 3 standard included, however, it will not be mandatory so you have to check if the particular device will support the Thunderbolt 3 devices over USB 4.0. Given the USB 4.0 standard is not a paid specification the devices and cables should be cheaper than the current Thunderbolt 3 ones. Due to the popularity of USB standard, almost all new laptops and PCs will have it, but again, not necessarily the Thunderbolt 3 backwards compatibility.So, in most cases, there will still be a lot of use out of this dock even after the new standards arrive if a compatible laptop is purchased.As for the performance of this device, I was pleased, it worked very well as you would expect from a Belkin brand. I found the build quality and feature-richness to be somewhat comparable to well-known third-party brands such as Plugable, Anker, Ugreen, etc. so this is another third-party manufacturer I can recommend. However, not everything was as expected, it did end up heating up very much to the point where it was too hot to touch so maybe they could have improved the thermal design of this product. The housing is made out of tough plastic and is really sturdy, no complaints there, the cable though feels a bit flimsy, they could have made it a bit thicker or braided for the price.The device sports one Thunderbolt 3 cable for the laptop, two USB 3.1 ports, one Thunderbolt 3 port for the connected devices, one Ethernet port, one DisplayPort, one HDMI port, and one 3.5 mm port. The Thunderbolt 3 port supports charging the laptop up to 60 W through the attached cable, however, the laptop can also charge external devices as well since Thunderbolt 3 standard can charge the connected devices up to 60W and can daisy chain up to 6 devices so if your devices support daisy chaining you could connect up to 6 Thunderbolt devices to the laptop.Overall, this is a good and elegant solution for converting the laptop experience to a full desktop one using a single cable, however, I would have preferred it if instead of a cable they went with a port, the cable makes it very difficult to have a clean desktop. Given how short the cable is the dock has to be close to the laptop, as shown on the image, which makes it very difficult to cable manage and sometimes it can be difficult to plug the cables into the dock if you do not have enough room around the dock.Also, the asking price is very steep given the competition and that most devices have at least two Thunderbolt ports so buying a much cheaper Thunderbolt 3 dongle paired with a charging Thunderbolt 3 cable is a two cable solution that I do not mind at all if I could save up to £100, so personally, I wouldn't buy it.Looking at their Plus and Pro models I would say that they are a much better option when it comes to value for the money and would advise checking them out, they do not have attached Thunderbolt 3 cable.\",\n",
       "    'This is a review for the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Core with Dual 4K at 60Hz, 40Gbps Transfer Speeds, 60W Upstream Charging that was released in January of this year.Upon using this for a while, I have experienced no connectivity issues with this model that was reported for its predecessors.For an expensive piece of kit, I was quite surprised to receive this boxed in a simple small brown box with no other form of packaging to make it feel like a more polished product.I dont know whether this is a result of it being relatively new and perhaps still in the final stages of development.My job in this situation is to report on what I receive.  Hence I thought it important to bring this up.A seamless way to turn your macbook/laptop into a high powered desktop using only a single cable running into it.Theres ports in there to connect monitors, printers , drawing pads, keyboards, flash stick, mouse, speakers, hard drives amongst other things. Essentially anything that can connect to one of its ports.It\\'s a compact little unit measuring about 4\"x4\" and the height of about and inch tall.The cable length is short at 20cm, not a major thing as this needs to be placed very close to your laptop anyway.It weights just shy of 200g.  Slipping easily into a side pocket of the laptop bag.  Pretty worthy to take to the office.It allows an agreeable level of power to any connected devices, with the poss-through function.It can even charge the laptop through the Belkin, as long as you run the laptops power cable through the device.With a total of 7 very versatile ports, plus the charging feature and the fast speeds.  I\\'m swimming in good, simple connectivity, across all my devices without difficulty.It connects to the Thunderbolb ports on the MacOS Sierra 10.12 or later;  and the same port in the Windows 10 or later.A very good Macbook/laptop port expander.  Shame about the simple brown packaging.4 stars.',\n",

       "    'The Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Core is well made and is exceptionally versatile! It features 7 ports that includes ultra fast charging support for your devices when plugged in, aswell as fast processing and connectivity speeds. I have been using this device for transferring 4K video files from my flagship smart phone and I am incredibly impressed by the processing speed that this product facilitates! I was able to process 120gb of video footage to my external hard drive  In under an hour. I have tried using other products in the past, and they weren’t anywhere close as fast as this product. I would say that the ‘40gbs’ statement is very deceiving as this would imply that my files should’ve been transfer in 3 seconds, which wasn’t the case. I’m assuming that this doesn’t apply to my file transferring method. Regardless, I am still very content with the speeds!I would say that the design on this product variation is poor, and if you were to utilise all ports, you would have wires coming from all angles of the device, which wouldn’t be aesthetically pleasing for your desk. The device is still compact and can be easily fitted into your work bag, ready to take with you to the office. The packing the product came in was a plain eco friendly box with little branding, which wasn’t a bother to me as I usually discard the packaging upon receiving the product, and I’m glad that the packaging won’t have any environmental complications.I have yet to fully utilise this product to its full extent, however once I upgrade my setup and purchase 4K monitors, I will update this review and let you know my experience, and if the device overheats like other reviewers mentioned.',\n",
       "    'I’m reviewing the “Core” version of this item here; it’s quite a different shape and spec to the Plus and Pro models, so some of my comments only apply to the Core version.This is a neat little block of a dock. It’s a modest, matt black little square with two (fairly bright) LED lights on it, and it looks quite smart and professional.It works well and does what it ought. From my test Macbook I can happily drive a triple-monitor set-up- the laptop’s own monitor plus the DP and HDMI outputs from this, both of which handle my monitor’s maximum resolutions- which chugs along nicely with no apparent processor struggles or blips. I can run my ethernet connection through it and be reading files from a USB drive through it at the same time, and it just ticks along elegantly with no apparent problems and no sense of slowdown. I’ve run it for several hours straight in this set-up and it gets gently warm but I certainly wouldn’t describe it as overheating.The cable from the dock to the laptop is really quite short, just over 20cm, which will suit some desk arrangements more than others. I can store the dock underneath my laptop stand and have the cable curve round and connect with my laptop on top, which is quite a neat solution which hides a lot of cables (until the laptop’s removed)- but it’s quite tight and there’s not a lot of spare. Other people may well find they prefer to add a little USB-C extension cable into the equation to give a bit more flexibility. It’s hard-wired at the dock end so it has to be an extension, not a replacement.With cable connections on all four sides of the box, it’s quite a difficult box to arrange in an organised fashion, and simply plugging cables into it makes it look instantly messy, if that’s the kind of thing that bothers you. The Plus and Pro have a longer thinner layout with cables mostly on two sides, and that intuitively feels a bit neater. But if you have no concerns about cable management, and many don’t, then the compact size of the Core dock becomes a virtue.I want to give Belkin extra credit for the fully recyclable packaging as well. Tech manufacturers (including Belkin in the past) have often used excessive plastic showy packaging, shop-style packaging, even for online orders where the customer doesn’t need it- so I was pleasantly surprised to see Belkin are shipping these in sturdy cardboard. A big improvement.Some of the other reviews on this product seem to indicate that Belkin have had to revisit and revamp this product after initially making something that had problems. On the evidence of the one I received, everything seems to be sorted out now.For what it can do, it isn’t the cheapest dock on the market, and depending on the specs and speed that you need, there might well be a sub-hundred-quid dock on this site that’s just as capable of doing what you need it to. Nevertheless this does its job well, and in a nicely understated way. Reliability (this time) from Belkin.',\n",
       "    'As a result whats happening around world I needed to start working from home. And was trying to use just laptop but it does not do it as the screen are too small. Plus it is just more productive to work with two monitors as i can work much faster. As I use Mac pro I wanted to use a dock which would support macOS and Windows as we have two laptops and this Belkin doc was available. It is a small black box which will not take a lot of space on a table and I really like what compactability.As most of a docks, it charges a laptop while working which is a good function, no need to think about plugging in a laptop. It has 7 ports which cover all the needs for working from home from a keyboard/mouse to speakers. And it can support up to a 2 x 4k screens at once. So far had no big problems with it. Although i connected just two simple monitors and mouse with a keyboard so i am not using it on a full potential. However , i noticed through the day it gets quite hot. Which is a bit of concern on how it will impact its performance after using it for a longer time. As the price are really high , so i would hope it would last for a long time.

       "    \"This is a review for the Core version of this dock, which is important as the pro version, also on this product page, has issues, according to Belkin themselves.This Core version works well; it's  literally plug and play, and, once installed, the transfer speeds seem really good. The included thunderbolt cable is rather short (only about six inches), but this is good in some ways as you don't get feet of cable dangling everywhere.  The ports all work well for attaching most devices, but connecting a monitor via the display port seems to be a bit hit and miss; the image quality is not as good as I thought it should be (and not as good as when using another brand of dock), being seemingly somewhat less clear. Other than that, it's okay; however I have to knock off a couple of stars for the slightly disappointing video output.\",\n",

       "    \"Prezzo alto per questo dock (al momento circa 190 euro – settembre 2020), ma come lecito aspettarsi si paga il marchio e sotto questo punto di vista Belkin è una garanzia, nonostante si trovano ottimi prodotti simili a prezzi inferiori.Va fatto subito notare che questo dock richiede l’alimentazione supplementare, e la confezione non include l'adattatore per la spina o il cavo di tipo USB-C per alimentarlo, non solo, all’interno della scatola troveremo anche un messaggio che ci dice di acquistarlo, a questo prezzo me lo sarei aspettato incluso. Senza alimentazione esterna qualcosa poterebbe funzionare, ma il PC difficilmente è in grado di dare la giusta potenza, quindi per un utilizzo corretto dovrete per forza di cose procurarvi un alimentatore esterno.È realizzato interamente in plastica, di buona qualità, ovviamente, con piedini antiscivolo sul fondo e aperture per una migliore ventilazione in vari punti. In alto abbiamo due LED, uno indica se l'adattatore è acceso e l'altro se è attualmente in funzione. Il funzionamento è molto semplice, una volta che lo hai collegato a un Thunderbolt e alimentato, non resta che utilizzare le porte che ci servono. Personalmente lo sto utilizzando su un Notebook Sony collegato ad un monitor hdmi, utilizzo di rado anche l’ingresso di rete RJ45 e le porte USB 3.1, ed il tutto funziona alla perfezione. E’ possibile anche collegare due monitor 4k a 60Hz, sfruttando oltre la porta HDMI anche quella DisplayPort (se il monitor ne è dotato)La caratteristica più importante di questo dock è il fatto che supporti il collegamento simultaneo di due display 4k a 60Hz, nonostante vadano collegati con due attacchi diversi (HDMI e DisplayPort), per il resto è un buon dock che però offre caratteristiche che si trovano in prodotti simili ma venduti a molto meno, nonostante ciò Belkin è una garanzia in termini di affidabilità, ma il prezzo è davvero alto.\",\n",

En el caso de la core necesitas un cable hdmi para un monitor y uno display port para el otro.En cambio, si necesitas conectar solo una pantalla o quieres un adaptador con un puerto ethernet y algunos otros usb para conectar periféricos este no te interesará porque los hay mucho más económicos en dicho caso.Belkin Thunderbolt 3 CorePUNTOS A FAVOR+ Permite 2 pantallas 4k a 60hz.+ Los dos puertos usb son 3.1PUNTOS EN CONTRA- Si conectas dos monitores debes usar dos cables distintos, hdmi y displayport.- La presentación de la caja muy cutre.COMPARACIONESMini vs CoreLos dos llevan la misma cantidad de puertos, pero la versión mini en vez de llevar un displayport tiene solo hdmi y ambos puertos usb son versiones anteriores usb 3.0 y usb 2.0 a diferencia de los dos usb 3.1 que lleva la variante core.Core vs PlusEl plus añade un puerto usb 3.1 y otro usb c más con respecto a la versión core y, además, ahora ambos puertos de salida para los monitores son displayport. La versión plus es más recomendable si necesitas conectar más de dos periféricos.Plus vs ProLa versión top (pro) como diferencia principal es que permite una mayor salida de 85w con respecto a las demás variantes de 60w.Otra característica que cambia son los dos puertos usb c que mientras en la versión plus eran 3.2 en este caso son thunderbolt 3 permitiendo la máxima transferencia, en uno de los cuales se aconseja el uso para la carga del portátil y el otro para los periféricos como bien puede ser una pantalla 4k (si se conecta una más iría al puerto displayport).En cuanto a los puertos usb-a el Pro tiene 5 (cuatro de 3.0 y uno de 3.1) con respecto al Plus que lleva solo 3 de 3.1.Otra característica que le diferencia al Pro con respecto a las demás variantes es el hecho de incluir un lector de tarjetas sd, pero por otro lado su tamaño también es el mayor de todos.CONCLUSIÓNDicho esto, las 4 variantes Belkin Dock tienen una característica importante en común: admitir la conexión simultánea de dos pantallas 4k a 60hz y en lo que se distingue cada versión es básicamente en la cantidad de puertos y sus tecnologías para conectar periféricos.Nota: las comparaciones las hice basándome en la información que hay en esta pagina, por lo que no descarto haberme equivocado en alguna parte.

Per verificare ciò meglio controllare l'alimentatore del computer.Un prodotto che mi ha un po' deluso, proposto ad un prezzo a mio avviso troppo alto.L'articolo mi è stato fornito gratuitamente all'interno del programma Amazon Vine.In cambio mi si chiede di effettuare una recensione reale, onesta, sincera ed imparziale.E così cerco sempre di fare.Né il produttore dell'articolo né tanto meno Amazon contattano o influenzano le voci Vine nelle recensioni.\",\n",

       "    'Core 7 in 1のレビューです。Thunderbolt3に対応した数少ない多目的ハブ。ちょうど初代Apple TV（古くてすみません）のような形とサイズ感です。ボディは比較的大きく重いです。形状からしても、毎日持ち歩くというよりは、職場や自宅に置いている機器をこれに繋いでおき、出先から戻った際にPCに接続するという使い方が適しているでしょう。ポートは、HDMI、Displayport（DP1.4）、有線LAN、USB-A（3.2）2基、オーディオジャック（ステレオミニ）、そしてUSB-Cがひとつ。それとPCに繋ぐ20cmほどのThunderboltケーブルが本機から出ています。力が入っているのは最初２つのモニタ関係ポートでしょう。２台の4Kモニタ（60Hz）接続に対応しているそうです。もちろんPC側のグラフィックが対応していなければいけないのは言うまでもありません。残念ながら我が家では4Kが1台しかなく検証はできていませんが、将来的に増やせたら追記したいと思います。なおモニタ1台であれば5Kまたは8K出力もできるそうですが、前者はそもそも製品が非常に少ないですし、これから増えそうな後者の場合30Hzとなるようで実用的ではないかもしれません。個人的に残念だと感じたのがUSB-Cポート。これはPC充電専用（60W以上のUSB電源を使うように書いてあります）となっており、ThunderboltはもちろんUSBとしてもデータ転送には対応していません。どうしてもうひとつデータ用のUSB-Cポートを付けてくれなかったのでしょう。Thunderboltポートが複数あるMacBookProなら良いのですが、12インチのMacBookやWindows機など1ポートのパソコンも少なくないと思います。またSDカードリーダー機能もあれば尚良かった。それから、長時間使用していると本機は結構熱を持つのもやや気になります。Thunderbolt機器として信頼できる製品です。でもだからこそ、そしてベルキンだからこそ、あえて要望を述べやや厳しい評価点とさせていただきました。',\n",
       "    'アダプターは不要で、USBや接続した機器からの給電でも動作します。思ったより小さいです。Macユーザーに向いてると思います。Macへの接続を1本のケーブルで行い、多くのデバイスがこちらで接続できます。特にMacBook Proを持っていれば有効に使えそうです。モニターに出力される映像が5Kであることが特徴かと思います。接続先はディスプレイポートとHDMIを使用することでデュアルが可能となります。',\n",

       "    '自宅PC用モニターとMac Book Proなどを使い分ける時に便利なドッキングステーションです。ハブ的なものなどはかなり安価に出回っていますが、Thunderbolt3対応で電源無しの製品でこの価格は安いと思います。接続的には特に問題なく、外出先で使う時にも接続端子などで困ることはないと思います。モニターの切り替えが不安定なのと、スリープ復帰時にモニターを認識しないと症状が頻発し、長時間使用する際や接続機器が多い場合などは本体がかなり熱くなるのが残念でした。機能的には不満がないので、改善されればかなり評価は高い製品だと思います。',\n",
       "    '在宅ワークで、仕事用にモニターも購入し、接続して使っています。プライベート用のPCもあり、両者をモニターにつなぎながら、使っています。いろいろな接続方式に対応しており、柔軟に使用することが出来て便利です。重さはそれなりにあって、逆にデスクトップで使用するには安定していて良いです。持ち運びには少し重いかもですが、家庭でリモートワーク、在宅ワーク環境を快適にするには助かります。',\n",

       "    'デザインがよくコンパクトなのでとても気に入っています。今まで使ってみて動作も安定していて転送速度も速いのでストレスなく使えています。ポートがたくさんあり全て使っても特に不具合なく使えているので良いです。ただ本体自体が熱を持ちやすいのかすぐに熱くなってしまうところが難点かなと感じます。念のために扇風機などで冷やして使っています',\n",
       "    'たくさんの端子があるのであらゆる目的に使えそうです。音声端子のない特殊なパソコンでもこれをつなげば大丈夫。スピーカーにもヘッドホンにもつなげられます。HDMI端子、電源が供給できるUSB３コードもついていて至れり尽くせりですね。すばらしい。',\n",
       "    'なんせ色々と接続できるので大変便利です。特にダブルモニターで使いたいときは非常に便利。THUNDERBOLT 3仕様なのでMacBookや古いモデルでUSB-CやTHUNDERBOLTのものでは使えないので注意。価格的にも普通のユーザーには必需品とは思いませんが、財布に余裕があるななら持っていると便利だと思います。',\n",

However, the USB-A ports on this dock seems to have no more bandwidth once the monitors are connected and seem to be power-only. Meaning, you cannot use the USB ports for flash drives, external drives, microphones, keyboards (I only got my keyboard to work intermittently with the USB port; it didn't seem to be reliable), mice, etc. I find this to be very misleading in the description since they claim that these 2 USB ports would act like a hub. It doesn't seem to act that way. I haven't tested the ethernet port so I cannot comment on that, but I did read some reviews noting that this only supports up to 100Mbps.Luckily, I only wanted this dock for the 2 HDMI ports for my 2 1440p monitors and the dock meets those needs for me. I would stay away from this if you need additional functionality from this dock and others that look like this.\",\n",
       "    'Pros- Plug and play- Multiple display over HDMI worked perfectly with my MacBook pro- RJ45 port (ethernet port) supports GbE (1000BASE-T)- long thunderbolt 3 chord- excellent metal build, very sturdyCons- no pass through charging through USB-C PD- a bit pricy (but worth it)Overall this is a great buy. I tried most USB-C hubs from Anker and Aukey but none of them worked with Mac for multiple monitors. Apple officially supports multiple HDMI output over thunderbolt 3 thus this worked flawlessly.',\n",

       "   'content': [\"I bought this dock instead of the Thunderbolt 3 Express (which Apple recommends) since I thought having the extra USB ports would be nice.  Upon installing the dock, I started having problems with my internet connection only to find that my router's WAN connection was being dropped whenever the MacBook Pro would go to sleep.  Furthermore, video would not sync properly sometimes forcing me to disconnect and reconnect the cable from the Mac to get it going again.  Belkin tech support was less than helpful and kicked me back to Apple. These docks don't have a HUD either, so there is no way to tweak any settings or install new firmware AFAIK.  I called Apple, and after trying a few things they recommended re-installing the OS.  I didn't feel like doing that so I ordered a Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock.  All of the problems went away after installing the Express dock.  The only reason I gave this product 2 stars is because it did work flawlessly with my Alienware 17R4 laptop.\",\n",
       "    'Before buying this, my normal setup is a Macbook Pro  15\" (2017) connected to a LG 38UC99 monitor, which powers the Macbook and runs the display.  I already had USB hubs and adapters for memory cards, but figured it would be nice to have one device do it all.This Belkin device is either defective or it\\'s not compatible with Macbook Pros.  Wish I\\'d read the review about the 2016 Macbook Pro before ordering.  I\\'m returning mine because:1- It doesn\\'t charge my Macbook when connected.  That completely defeats the purpose of it.  This is without anything else connected!!  I have the latest macOS installed, and my Macbook charges fine through my LG monitor, so it\\'s not like it\\'s a Macbook issue.2- The cable that comes with it is super finnicky.  I had it connected and then it just gets disconnected randomly, and I have to try various ports on my laptop to get it to work again.3- The 4 USB ports on the back are slow!!!!  These cannot be USB-3.0, no way.  They charge slower than any USB I have ever tried!  Again, I am assuming I just got a defective product, otherwise, this is horrible.  I have other USB hubs/chargers bought from Amazon that are not Belkin, but just other brands, and they are much faster even with USB-2.0.  I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with this.4- It overheats when connecting to my Macbook and LG monitor.  I regularly got dialogs on my Macbook saying the hub is overheating and needs to be disconnected - maybe that\\'s why the cable would randomly disconnect?  Not sure, but either way, I think it\\'s dangerous how hot it gets, and seems like they really didn\\'t think some things through.tldr; it doesn\\'t do what it claims, even the USB ports are horrible.  may be defective or may not be compatible with Macbook Pro.',\n",

       "    \"I rarely write reviews, but AFTER I purchased this Belkin dock and ran into problems I stumbled upon one other purchaser who had similar problems and wrote about it. This dock does NOT have a usb-c power throughput power delivery port as do some others. You need to power your mac directly from a power supply into one of the mac's 4 thunderbolt (usb-c) ports. I plugged in 2 HDMI monitors into the Belkin dock (neither of which is 4K), plus an ethernet cable, and I was consuming so much power that the OEM Apple charger would NOT keep my 2017 MacBook Pro charged. My battery was so drained my mac lost all power and I could not recharge and reboot. I had to ship my mac back to Apple. Luckily, my 2017 MacBook was still covered by AppleCare. Apple replaced the logic board (which of course means you get to completely rebuild your mac when its returned), but the problem immediately reoccured.  The only workaround is to invest significantly more money on a newer MacBook pro power adapter (the 2017 comes with a 61 watt power supply. Newer macs have 87 watt and 96 watt supplies). Apple says the higher watt rated supply will not harm your mac, because of over charge protection.  I shelled out $80 more  for a 96 watt power supply and now the battery drain issue is gone. The 61 watt provided Apple power supply is too anemic, although, I did not notice a similar problem when the 2 HDMI monitors and ethernet cable ran directly into my mac, only when run through the Belkin dock. The whole point of a dock is to free up ports on the mac.  So, I'm not necessarily knocking Belkin, who has made some nice peripherals for mac owners, I'm just letting you know you may need more power than what mac shipped with your earlier mac.  Factor in that cost before you buy.\",\n",
       "    'Encountered various problems with the dock, replaced by amazon twice (meaning I am now on 3rd unit). Contacted Belkin support (very professional) and they confirmed a known issue with this type of dock and newer MacBook Pro, in combination with sleep mode. Belkin support stated that there was no firmware update/upgrade path for the unit. Belkin support essentially said that only a newly designed dock may be able to fix it, but there is no ETA for anything. My only options are to return or live with the errors/failures. My choice: ReturnSymptoms:When MacBook Pro wakes up from sleep state, Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro may malfunction. Error symptoms can be frequency issues on monitor connected to USB-C (flicker, etc.), complete loss of signal on Display Port. Only reboot of computer, in combination with possible power cycle of Belkin dock may resolve the issue. Also, while working on MacBook Pro, at random times, the display port may loose signal and may regain if monitor is power cycled and/or display port cable is disconnected/re-connected. But it may not recover and reboot/power cycle may required at that point.The MacBook Pro may experience kernel panics and totally crash when monitor cables are unplugged/re-connected (USB-C and Display Port).The 1st unit I had did not recover from one Display Port failure and the Display Port died completely. The 2nd and 3rd unit behave similar, where reboot/power cycle of Mac and dock usually resolve.I also tested various different video cables and monitors on different ports, different thunderbolt cables (including genuine Apple TB cable) always same/similar results with various failures and/or malfunctions.My setup:I have a MacBook Pro 16\", purchased Nov 2019, macOS 10.15.61 x 4K ViewSonic via USB-C to HDMI direct connected to Mac2 x 2K (2560x1440) monitors (1 with USB-C to HDMI, 1 with straight Display Port)  connected to Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro.Additionally 1 web cam via USB 3, one external SSD (for Time Machine) via USB 3Belkin dock connected on left side of Mac, 4K ViewSonic on right side of MacFindings:Energy Saver settings to Prevent computer from sleeping, with Automatic graphics switching can bring limited stability for several hours and/or work days. Disabling the Automatic graphics switching also yields longer periods without failure.It was not possible to work one full week without issues.

When they come out with a new hardware release then I will try it again. But, until then I will have to try and find a different solution.Since Belkin already knows about this issue, I wish they would publish an advisory on Amazon and everywhere online, so that nobody has to waste as much time as I did during my extensive \"Beta\" tests.It is possible that Apple has some room for improvement as well, because the dock malfunction should not lead to any kernel panic.',\n",
       "    'Long story short: Do not buy. A better long-term investment is a separately powered hub. If you depend 100% on your peripherals, avoid this product at all costs and get a separately powered hub. This purchase was a waste. List money AND productivity. Two external displays and one external 1TB drive resulted in my MacBook taking 10-20-30 minutes to boot up. Unplug the external drive and boot up takes seconds. I have three external drives. I only use one at a time. Boot up is slow no matter what external drive is plugged in. When I had two monitors and two USB drives plugged in, my MacBook would not boot up at all. Apple logo would come up, go away, come up, go away. This went on for 90 minutes. Apple support said the all the peripherals were sucking power from the MacBook. It took 4 hours of problems and Apple phone support to resolve. They said for more than 2 peripherals, get a separately powered hub. I don’t entirely blame Belkin. Apple is mostly to blame. They’re sleek streamlined products just result in bulky, cluttered, hard-to-transport, buy-try-fail extra peripherals.',\n",

Issue returns.Went through all possible combinations of cables and monitors, as well as ports on the 15\" of which there are 4, and I ran in to the issue. That\\'s a lot of cases.So, that said, this display link issue has not been fixed, and is a total deal breaker when one of the major selling points of this hub is dual 4k support, and just general dual display link support in general. Even with a single monitor, the issue happens.Belkin, so many people are talking about this issue, why hasn\\'t it been resolved? There are enough 5 star reviews that I had faith in the product, as a lot of times 1 star reviews can be worded poorly and not go in to enough detail, so it just ends up sounding like disgruntled customers.

I\\'m not replacing my keyboard or mouse to accommodate  a docking station.Also annoying is that if I connect an ethernet cable from my router into the docking station, I cannot use it to get Internet on either my PC or Mac.  I have to switch to Wifi.  When I connect the ethernet cable directly into my PC, I get Internet through it.If I can\\'t use my mouse or keyboard with the docking station and if I can\\'t take take advantage of the stronger and more stable Internet connection through an ethernet cable, then this is not much of a docking station.Normally, I\\'ve had go experiences with Belkin products. According to their website, Belkin recommends their Belkin USB-C® Dual Display Docking Station, INC002 for Macs with the new M1 chip. I\\'ve ordered one of these. Even though I don\\'t need to connect multiple displays, hopefully it will at least let me connect my ethernet, mouse, and keyboard to both my PC and Mac.',\n",

Given the price of more robust Thunderbolt 3 docks and my specific use case, this is a no brainer.

Figured Belkin would be reliable. The dock itself is pretty nice and not too big. It had all the ports i needed so it was perfect for me.I hooked it up and it started working pretty well off the bat. I didnt test every port but i did test connecting two monitors, using the SD card slot, using the front usb port and one usb port on the back. I also used the ethernet port. Worked well. It did get a little warm but nothing to worry too much about.The issue i finally noticed after a day was that when i woke up my computer from sleeping, it would turn on but it would not automatically reconnect to the dock. It would wake up on the laptop screen instead of my monitors. The only way i got it to go back to the monitors was by unplugging and plugging the usb c cable. Sometimes I even had to do it a couple of times before the dock finally recognized my computer again. This is pretty annoying since i want a dock that just works.

Each side has some cables coming out. It makes it hart do hid it behind you screen or close to some wall.- power pass-thru somehow registered as only 45W (compared to 60W advertised) with my 61W Apple brick. This may be a design limitation and probably my oversight.- unnecessary audio port. It\\'s surprisingly annoying on Macs because you cannot simply disable it and it gets in the way as selected Audio Out quite often.Ultimately I ended up returning the dock and went with CalDigit Dock Mini DisplayPort version, which has no support for power but fits better my use case',\n",
       "    \"Previous to this hub, I had a really cheap one. That one was more like an adapter, with a lot of ports. It worked fine, but I had to cobble it together with more adapters and it didn't have enough ports to support everything. So I decided to spring for the real deal, a proper TB3 hub that would support all of my devices.The good news is, it can drive almost all of those devices, when they can be found. I'm running two monitors, a keyboard, and a mouse off of it currently. The one device it wouldn't support was my webcam. That works fine off of the laptop, but has a flicker when used through this hub.The  bad news is, and this is really a deal breaker, it often fails to detect usb devices (the keyboard and mouse) when I reconnect the computer to the dock (this sometimes happens after the computer goes to sleep as well). This makes me reluctant to disconnect the laptop when the dock is working, which defeats its purpose. Basically I wasted hundreds of dollars on this device. Do yourself a favor, keep looking.\",\n",

I have contacted support and the only conclusion was to send me a new unit, which has the exact same issues.The dock does everything I want, otherwise, and I will happily give a 5-star review, except for this resolution issue.

Belkin’s site doesn’t offer drivers and seems to expect it to just work but that hasn’t been the case.

Here\\'s my setup:Monitor 1:Dell U2713HM purchased in Dec 20132560 x 1440 @ 60HzConnection to dock: Monitor DisplayPort to dock DisplayPort using a 6.6ft Ivanky DP-to-DP cable (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078HVDMW2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)Monitor 2:Dell S2716DG purchased in Sept 20172560 x 1440 @ 60HzConnection to dock: Monitor HDMI to Dock Thunderbolt 3 port via AmazonBasics 10ft High-Speed HDMI cable (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014I8T0YQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) plugged into an Itanda HDMI-to-USB-c Adapter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JH8DM12/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)This monitor is capable of 144Hz, but I have a separate gaming rig that runs it at that frequency, and 60Hz is fine for what I use my Macbook for, so not looking for anything above that from this setup.With this setup, the S2716DG works fine at all times: after the Macbook reboots, plugging the Macbook into the doc, waking that Macbook and the monitor from sleep, all of it.However, the U2713HM is hit or miss. Probably 80% of the time, after waking the Macbook from sleep or plugging the Macbook into the dock, it doesn\\'t wake up. It detects something but then goes to sleep. Luckily, when I bring up Display Preferences on the Macbook, the Macbook does detect it (even though the monitor isn\\'t on), so the U2713HM display settings panel  shows up on either the other monitor or on the Macbook screen. This allows me to drop the U2713HM to 1080p, which causes it to turn on, and if I wait a couple seconds, moving it back to 2560 x 1440 works just fine. From there it works great.So this is a bit of a pain, but not a dealbreaker for me.I did try a couple different DP-to-USB-C cables for the U2713HM. One of them could go no higher than 1600 x 900, but the other could do 2560 x 1440. However as soon as I reboot or the Macbook goes to sleep, it won\\'t wake up and the U2713HM display settings panel doesn\\'t appear.When I used these same monitors by plugging them directly into the Macbook (one DisplayPort straight to a Thunderbolt port on the Macbook, the other with the HDMI/USB/charging Thunderbolt adapter from Apple), these problems didn\\'t occur.So it is clear that the dock itself is a factor, as is cable quality, the age of the monitor (guessing here), what other monitors are plugged in and what resolution/frequency they are running at, and probably a few other factors I\\'ve missed.For the convenience the dock gives me, this small headache is worth it.',\n",
       "    'I used this driving station with a HP laptop that did had a thunderbolt port. The original setup to connect the docking station was a bit wonky, as I had to call Belkin support to get the driving station to connect to the laptop. Once connected, I used the following features: Ethernet connection, dual monitor, and power the computer through the docking station. The dual monitor and power functionality seemed to work, but at times, the Ethernet connection would drop. I confirmed during these times that my ISP was still working and that I had a live Ethernet connection to my other computer from the same router. To mitigate the issue, I simply detached and reattached the thunderbolt cable to the laptop.  Thus, the failure appeared to be coming from the docking  station. In my view, this was more than an annoyance, as I could not be certain whether the Ethernet connection would remain stable. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product.',\n",

I have a wireless mouse and keyboard connected to it, an ethernet connection, and two 1080p 144hz displays. The MacBook and Dell use both along with their integrated displays for a triple display setup, however the only downside is that I can only run at 120hz and not the full 144hz. But it's not a big dealbreaker and I can deal with 120hz since this setup isn't a permanent setup.The build quality is pretty good. Metal top and bottom housing, with glossy plastic sides. This is the first design downside. Glossy plastic only looks good for a short amount of time, after that it's nothing but scratches. I really hope that a matte finish is available as glossy plastic looks horrible after a bit of time, and I wish every company will ditch glossy plastic.A suggestion is a detachable cable, although at this price point, i don't expect it.Overall, this is a great device. Replacing the glossy plastic with a matte finish will make it even better.\",\n",

No styrofoam or clam-shell plastic to fight with. Everything was well packaged, and well organized. In short, Yale has done an excellent job in their packaging. It arrived in perfect condition.In the box:You get the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock, 2.6ft Thunderbolt 3 Cable and 2 instruction manual.Build Quality (Rating 5/5):It feel feels strong and premium, The body is made from what it seems a durable high quality aluminum, with matt gray finish and the front ports are made from black plastic.Design (Rating 5/5):It has a nice visually beautiful black on grey finsh with sleek shape with clean lines, smooth edges and minimalistic design with wide black front and back plastic ports.You get in the front a USB A 3.1 Gen 2, USB C 3.1 Gen 2, Sd card reader and audio in and out. In the back you get, 4x USB A 3.0, gigabyte ethernet, display port 1.4, 2x Thunderbolt 3, DC in 170W.More Info:That dock is a very beautiful and a powerful workstation that utilizes all the benefits of Thunderbolt 3, I use it with my new MacBook Pro 16 inch, as I mostly use my MacBook on the go and at home, and I love that I get to only use one cable for everything, like super-fast data transfer up to 40 Gbps, 4K dual monitor, 85W charging to charge my laptop, and multiple ports to connect my peripherals and network via USB-A 3.1, USB-C, Ethernet, SD and more. The best part is you can connect all this to your Mac\\'s Thunderbolt 3 or regular windows laptop by USB-C and it only requires connecting a single cable, it\\'s insane.This is a no brainer for me, I have 2 monitors and I used to have many cables for the hdmi for each screen and another for the charger and another for the mouse and keyboard, and for the sd card reader and for the ethernet cable as my wifi in my home office signal is very weak. It\\'s really very beautiful just sitting on my desk and it\\'s saved me a ton of accessories and cable management, it can\\'t get better than this, until they invent wireless charging.I\\'ve been using it for a while now, and been running my 2 4k monitors and using my mixer through the audio jack and almost every peripheral is connected and it\\'s running like butter.The Good:- Amazing build quality.- Beautiful Design.- Feels very premium- USB-A 3.1- USB-C 3.1- SD card reader- Audio in/out- 170W PSU (Power Supply Unit)- Thunderbolt 3 (connects to laptop)- Thunderbolt 3 port (connects peripherals)- 1x DisplayPort- GB Ethernet- PowerfulThe Bad:- $299 is highConclusion:Very beautiful, amazing build quality and very powerful dock, very easy to use, everything is just plug and play. I cannot recommend this enough, it\\'s built very well, and feels very premium, it\\'s perfect if you use your laptop a lot.Thanks for taking the time to read this review.

       "    'I was looking for a DisplayPort based dock because my previous TB3 dock had some issues running HDMI attached monitors that didn\\'t appear when connected using DisplayPort.  The Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus dock has dual DisplayPort outputs at a reasonable price so it appeared to fit the bill.Based on the specs, this dock seems to be based on the newer Intel Titan Ridge TB3 chipset which supports DisplayPort 1.4 and 8k@30hz monitors.  I only have monitors that support 4k@60Hz so I can\\'t test the 8k function.The dock itself was well packaged in a compact box.  Documentation is sparse with only a small flyer describing the ports an the typical FCC/warranty statement.  There were no specifications included.The dock has some nice connectivity features with minimalistic design - Alongside the two full size DisplayPort outputs are an audio jack, three type A USB ports (2x10G and 1x5G), and a pair of 10G USB-C ports, and an ethernet port that seems to be based on the Realtek chipset.The dock supports up to 60W power delivery on the computer port which is located on the front of the unit - Belkin have designed this unit on the assumption that your laptop will sit to the front rather than off to the side.First, ports and connectivity.  There is no TB3 passthrough output.  There are a pair of 10G USB-C ports but these do not support DP alt-mode passthrough so they cannot be used to attach a USB-C monitor.  With this dock you\\'re stuck with the DisplayPort outputs.There are a good number of high speed USB ports but with only three TypeA ports I had to attach a hub to connect all the devices I needed.I have had a number of issues with this dock.First, the supplied cable versus the description.When I ordered the dock the description indicated that it came with a 3ft TB3 cable.  It came with an 18 inch cable instead (the item description has since been corrected).  I contacted support who were friendly but not helpful in the slightest.  Everything has to be \"escalated to management\" who never responds (except apparently to retroactively change the descriptions to match what was actually in the box).  More on this later.Second, I\\'ve had quite a few operational and functionality issues.I needed more TypeA ports than are available on this dock so I had to attach a hub.  One of my monitors has a built-in hub that can has both a USB-C and TypeB input.  The USB-C input worked well with my previous dock so this is the first thing I tried.  However, with this dock the built-in hub was non-functional using the USB-C cable, so I had to burn a TypeA port to use the built-in USB3 hub.Once connected I had odd random issues where attached USB1 devices (such as my keyboard and mouse) would vanish.  Thinking this may be the monitor I moved these devices to a passive USB3 hub which exhibited similar behavior - devices would work for a while but eventually would vanish.  Ultimately I had to attach a separate downstream USB2 hub to get my keyboard/mouse to work reliably.This dock has also been extremely glitchy with my pair of 4k monitors and my 13inch 2018 Macbook Pro running macos Mojave.My LG display has been mainly reliable and comes out of sleep almost immediately, but I have experienced flashing/flickering when attached to the outermost port.  I\\'ve not experienced that issue when this monitor is attached to the centermost port.My Viewsonic Professional monitor (a high-end color accurate 4K display) takes a long time to come out of sleep and sometimes isn\\'t detected at all.  Usually when this happens the monitor doesn\\'t wake up but one time the monitor woke up in mirror mode with the Mac claiming there was no monitor attached.  I had to power down the dock to resolve this issue.  I also had issues with this monitor using the certified DisplayPort cable that was bundled with the monitor - eventually I had to swap this with a short cable to improve stability.Because of the detection and waking issues my Mac frequently interpreted this as display topology changes and would often generate a new display profile and/or desktop arrangement.After much experimentation and troubleshooting I was able to arrive at a combination of cables, port attachment and monitor settings that were mostly reliable.  It was very important that both monitors were configured for DP 1.2 - this dock supports DP 1.4, but doesn\\'t seem to work well with DP 1.1 devices.Although my LG monitor has a setting to enable DP 1.2 mode, my Viewsonic was challenging due to differences between the monitor menus and the manual - the monitor has a setting to \"disable DP 1.1\" whereas the manual claims this setting should be \"enable DP 1.2\".  When set to \"disable DP 1.1\" it takes less time to wake up (still not as fast as the LG) but I\\'ve experienced occasional detection issues in this mode.It\\'s quite possible that behavior will be different with macos Catalina as it likely has updated TB3 and display drivers but I have not yet tested this.Third, technical support.I normally don\\'t review technical support for products because I almost never need to use it.  Because of the cable issue and the problematic operation I contacted technical support several times using the support number included in the package.  Although the support people were friendly the first one I contacted wasn\\'t trained on the product, and none of the support personnel were empowered to do anything except \"escalate issues to management\".  After the first interaction where I was promised a callback from third level support (they never called) the case was closed \"for lack of customer response\".When I called back to reopen the case the second rep was also friendly, again \"escalated to management\", and actually provided a \"still waiting\" update after a couple of days.  That was two weeks ago, and I\\'ve had no updates from them since then.  I assume the case has gone into a black hole.My takeaway is that if you actually need product support you\\'re unlikely to get that from Belkin, whether a simple issue such as \"wrong cable in the box\" or \"product doesn\\'t work properly\".All in all this dock has been significantly more problematic than my older HDMI TB3 dock, but the benefits from DisplayPort outweight the HDMI issues so I\\'m continuing to use it for now.  I will almost certainly be looking for a new dock to replace this one.',\n",

The dock works with Mac/Window/Linux/ChromeOS devices as long as they have the supported USB-C port.  I tested a 2018 Macbook Pro (dual boot with Linux Mint), 2018 Asus Chromebook, and a Dell Precision 5530.  Every machine worked perfect except for the Dell, which has larger power requirements than the dock can provide.  This didn’t stop the dock from working, but it causes warnings to pop up.

       "    'The advent of USB-C-only laptops has made the use of a dock pretty much mandatory. This dock provides two HDMI out connections (4k at up to 60 Hz), one USB 3.0 port, one USB 2.0 port, and ethernet port.Typical of a Belkin product, the dock feels very solid, and does not move around a lot when plugged in. It has a compact connector, which is nice because it allows the second Thunderbolt port on the computer to be used concurrently.There are only two shortcomings. First, there is no pass-through power. This is not a deal-killer, as long as your laptop has a second port for power. It seems like a large oversight, however, in a dock with two video ports since it seems likely that driving three displays would drain the battery quickly. My only other complaint is that this is more of a video adapter than a true \"dock,\" since an actual dock would offer more ports and functionality. Nonetheless, it does everything it says it will do, so I did not deduct any stars.Be advised, this is a Thunderbolt 3-only adapter. It will not work as a USB 3.1 to USB 2.0 adapter. This means it will not work with most lower-end PCs or Chromebooks, which greatly limits its versatility.If you want to drive two external monitors at 4k/60Hz, have a thunderbolt port, and don\\'t need power passthrough or a lot of additional functionality, this is a solid choice. The build quality is excellent, and the form factor is just right.',\n",
       "    \"Tested with the Mac Pro (2019) and Apple Pro Display XDR were the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro as well as the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus (this item). The two units are similar in that they both provide compatibility with the Mac OS, and both provide sufficient power pass through to be used as a MacBook Pro power source while simultaneously providing all the desired ports. The BIG difference is that the Pro allows you to connect the Thunderbolt 3 cable directly to the dock from the Mac Pro, and then another USB-C Thunderbolt 3 cable from the dock to the XDR monitor (or similar). The Plus, on the other hand, does not have a USB-C Thunderbolt 3 output, but simply the input which can then be directed to the Displayport outputs. It does, however have two USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 ports as outputs.Let's go through some other differences: the Pro model, which has a retail price about fifty dollars higher than the Plus model, has a metal construction, and weighs about 15 ounces (in case you'll be toting it with your laptop). The Plus is plastic construction and weighs 9.5 ounces. The Pro is thinner and easier to throw in a backpack as a result.Only the Pro model has an SD card reader. The Plus model, on the other hand, has two Displayport outputs while the Pro model has only one. The Pro model has a couple of extra USB-A 3.0 ports (four total) plus a USB-A 3.1 port, while the Plus has 2 USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 ports and 1 USB-A 3.1 Gen 2 port.The Pro has a 170 watt power supply brick, while the Plus has a somewhat lighter 125w power supply. The Pro can deliver up to 85w to a laptop, while the Plus can range up to 60w.Both units are well made, well supported by Belkin, and work as expected. Reading through Belkin's product information on their site will confirm whether you'll have the desired level of performance after all the wires are plugged in. Note that the AC cords for both units are grounded, extend to a separate power brick, with a wire then going from the brick to the dock.\",\n",
       "    'The Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock PLUS is one amazing docking station for laptops. One cord allows you to charge AND use a wide variety of peripherals at the same time. No need for your own power cord since this does it all. NOTE: One item not mentioned, the power cord MUST be hooked up in order use all the features of the dock.Fearures:NOTE: I see some descriptions mention this having a card reader, this one did not.- It has its own power supply connected to a Thunderbolt 3 Type-C port which charges your laptop while you work. (Up to 60W.)- It provides mic and speaker support with an in/out audio port.- It also includes 5-USB ports. (3-USB-A ports and 2-USB-C ports.)- You also get 2-Display ports for HD monitors/displays.- Gigabit Ethernet.On a light note, I’ve included a photo of how ridicules this can get… not something you would want to do, but just to show what this dock is capable of. I had 3 USB hard drives, a USB hub with 2 thumb drives as well as a SD card reader. The hilarious problem I had was keeping track of what was on the desktop and which to eject and from what port. I still had 2 USB-C ports open as well as the 2 display ports and ethernet. All I can say is WOW and remember, this was all on ONE cord, which also was charging my laptop! Very impressive!I have a more traditional 6 port dock that simply plugs into the side but this blew that away when it came to transfer rates. The same 1 gig file was 50% faster than my one year old dock. I will also be testing this with games running from an external HD running Windows 10 under BootCamp and will be posting my impressions. Right now using my old dock, it’s simply too slow and a lot of lag.The only cons on this dock are the high price and bulk of having two peripherals. Most users will opt for something less expensive. However, you will not get close to the versatility or power. With laptops having soldiered in drives, this may be a more viable option than a new computer. As for having two peripherals, one is a power supply replacement and the other provides pretty much everything you need. Not something you would travel with, since it’s more for a stationary desktop use, but it may be worth it since you don’t have to have your original power supply.UPDATE:As mentioned above I was going to try this on a 13” MacBook Pro running the game Destiny 2 under Windows 10 with BootCamp. The results were nothing short of amazing.The previous setup used a traditional dock that plugs into two USB-C ports, to provide 3 USB-3 ports, one for a fast SSD external drive and the other two for the controllers. The game was Destiny 2. Controllers were very slow to almost unresponsive and the frame rate was so slow as to make the game unusable, especially after the recent update. Not to mention the laptop had to use ii’s own charger at all times.New Results- Frame rate highly improved from not being able to play to good.- Controller works perfectly with no issues with responsiveness.- Excellent transfer speed.- All while charging the through the charging port.- Not to mention I still have one of the Mac’s original USB-C ports free.I highly recommend this dock.',\n",
       "    \"USB-C finally managed to become a de-facto standard after Thunderbolt tried to leapfrog USB 3.x and eventually merged with Thunderbolt 3. The smaller size of the USB-C connector enables smaller (thinner) laptops and that's apparently what it's all about, especially for 2-in-1 computers. A side effect is that most devices now end up with USB for everything (monitor, UBS drives, and charging). That's all great but let's face it, most of us have peripherals with older connectors like Ethernet, USB-A or HDMI. (My Lenovo C930) has two USB-C ports and that's pretty much it. Say hello to external docks and dongles.The Belkin dock  takes an USB-C port and breaks it out into two 4k hdmi ports and one for ethernet. It's unclear why Belkin chose to include both USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 outlets, but it's your flavors for the two USB-A ports. There is no external power to the dock (or to charge laptop), which relies on the USB-C port to power the dock. Make sure to have a separate port (whatever the format) to keep the laptop charged for longer meetings, since the Belkin dock does not provide charging power to the host laptop.Overall, the design is okay, even if I am not a fan of the glossy plastic wrapped by a coated aluminum housing. Performance seemed sufficient for my purposes, but I generally don't need gigabit speeds even if they're welcome.The dock is easy to set up, but business users should be aware that Windows 10 with limited user rights will require an admin account to install the dock. Otherwise it will refuse to work, and that could be a big issue if you're on the road (with a customer) and try to use it for the first time.\",\n",

       "    'I have a Belkin hub that I used before.  And the hub works as it was advertised - able to connect all the other peripherals that I have with my MacBook Air.  What I didn’t know was how fast is the connection speed between the portable hard drive and other peripherals to my laptop.  So, I plugged in this new Belkin doc.  First of all, without reading the instruction, I also plugged the MacBook Air power charger to the doc, just like I did with the hub.  I didn’t see my portable hard drive on the list.  I almost called the customer support and told them that I had a defective item.  And then I read description on the website that this doc has 85 W upstream charging which means that it will charge your computer without you needing to plug the computer own power charger.  In my experience, if you do that, you void the other functions of this doc.  So, you don’t need to the laptop power charger anymore when you use this doc.  Once I realized my mistake, I soon notice that having this doc connecting to the portable drive, which house my 500 GB iTunes music collection, means that I can access my music or other documents that I put on my portable hard drive way faster than using the hub.  A lot faster!! Having most of documents, pictures and music stored on portable drive, means that having this doc is a miracle.  There is no delay anymore getting to those files, even when opening a quite large video files.I don’t have a 4K display but I have an HD monitor that I sometimes connect my laptop to if I want to have a big screen to work at.  The doc have only display port connection, which means, if your monitor connect with HDMI cable, you need an adapter to connect the doc with the monitor.  I got the adapter from the local Micro Center here for around $10.  So the last question is does this doc worth the close to the $300 price range?  I think thunderbolt 3 dock connection is probably be a standard for awhile, and if you value the connection time with the other peripheral you have attached to the laptop and the ability to connect to 2 4K monitors (which I don’t have), this doc might be worth the money.  If not, then get something cheaper with less features.',\n",
       "    'I am honestly quite disappointed with the connection options for this dock. This should really be considered more of a USB3 dock instead of a Thunderbolt dock. Why? For just one glaring omission on Belkins part (and I suspect so that they could entice people to buy the more expensive model): there is no Thunderbolt port on the dock! This means you CANNOT daisy chain thunderbolt devices with this dock, which is one of the important aspects of the thunderbolt protocol, in my opinion (especially for laptops and docks like this). This really has no additional functionality as compared to a USB3 dock, while costing more because Belkin had to put some thunderbolt hardware inside. There isn\\'t even a USB-C port on this dock, which is a very puzzling design choice (the USB-C port on the side of this dock is for power input).At my home desk, I have a CalDigit thunderbolt dock I\\'ve used for years. It has another thunderbolt port on the back, so I have a Sonnet PCIe breakout box connected to the CalDigit dock with a 40Gb fiber network card inserted. So, with just one cable at home I can charge my laptop and connect to my CalDigit dock, which breaks out to a 34\" wide 1440p screen, USB expansion ports, and a PCIe enclosure. That is one of the best aspects of the thunderbolt protocol when it comes to laptop usage (in my opinion), and this Belkin hub is highly crippled in this regard.This Belkin dock will work ok for very basic usage scenarios, but it doesn\\'t provide any additional functionality that you couldn\\'t get with a USB dock, despite carrying a price premium.',\n",

I have a different brand of hub that is way better.— The reason this isn't as good as my other brand is that it requires the computer cord to power it. It doesn't come with its own power cord! It doesn't work consistently with my power cord. So, I can only use it consistently if it's plugged into one lightning port and my laptop power cord is plugged into my laptop via another lightning port. That isn't ideal at all.— The device draws power from the computer via the setup mentioned above. Again. Not ideal.Overall, it's helpful for my recording setup, but I'm not using it to its fullest capability because of the limitations with not having its own power cord.

       "    \"This review is for the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus (not the Pro).I knew my husband would want this dock when I saw it, so I requested it. He has been working on and off with the dock for a couple of weeks, he finally was able to tell me about it. After getting a new high-end laptop, he said he was really looking forward to using this dock at his work especially because his laptop has a Thunderbolt 3 port. It does work. However, he spent around 2 hours trying to figure out why he could only get one of the two office monitors to even be recognized by the system. After eliminating one possibility after another, he finally got the second monitor to work only after he used a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter at the docking station. The monitor that's made by Dell worked just fine and the problematic one is made by Lenovo; however, his desktop system has never had any problems with it. Both monitors are a few years old, which may be the biggest part of the problem, but if the dock had reported *something*, it would have made this much simpler. As for the positives, the system automatically recognizes it as a Thunderbolt Dock and Windows launches the Thunderbolt Control Center automatically. It's got great data transfer rates on both the Ethernet port and the USB 3.1 ports. His high-end laptop requires more power than Thunderbolt can deliver but his work-issued Dell business laptop's Thunderbolt port works great and also powers it. If had worked with his monitors that have been reliable, he would have given it an enthusiastic 5 stars; if it had reported that it couldn't work with one of his monitors, he wouldn't have been very annoyed, and he would have given it 4 stars; but since he had the hassle of figuring out that it simply doesn't like one of his monitors, he is giving it 3 stars. Good, but you have to use monitors it likes.\",\n",
       "    'This is a brand I am familiar with and have experienced a consistent level of quality and reliability. I am using this device to replace an existing docking station that did not have Thunderbolt3 capability. The reason I wanted to make the change is because multiple external hard drives connected to my laptop through the old dock were noticeably slow.My previous dock used a standard USB 3.0 connection and the move to Thunderbolt3 increased the speed dramatically. Using crystalDiskMark software, the read speed of the connected hard drive is now 65 percent faster.Setup for Windows 10 is simple--connect all the peripherals to the dock and then connect to a Thunderbolt3 port on a laptop using the included cable. Then Windows 10  displayed a pop up window acknowledging it has detected an attached Thunderbolt device and required permission be granted before loading software and activating the device. Until that action was taken, which took a few seconds, nothing attached to the dock was recognized.The dock has a smaller footprint than my previous device so it requires less space. It also has both USB A and USB C ports along with USB 3.1 both generation 1 and 2. The dock is powered which means all peripherals are on as long as it’s plugged-in, but there is no status indicator light or on/off switch. So, when I remove my laptop from the dock, the only way to power down all the connected peripherals is to unplug the dock.This is inconvenient and because there is no status indicator light it isn’t possible to determine if it’s plugged in or not. Another possible issue is that the dock has no HDMI ports so to connect to some monitors, a display port or a USB device with an adaptor must be used. Five stars for performance but docking a star for lack of helpful user features.',\n",

Well because it combines all in one, everything runs much faster, eliminates bunch of cables and quite frankly it definitely satisfies my need to keep my space neat and organized. The body of this dock is solid and has a good weight to it, honestly I thought it’s going to be much lighter.Now let’s discuss the elephant in the room. Considering heavy price tag is it necessary? Well,  I had similar setup without it just not as fast transfer. It wasn’t necessary but it’s so much better.It’s like when you have old computer that is slowing you down but you refuse to get the new one because it’s not necessary and the old one can get the job done. Value for $ is one of my biggest rating points and after carefully considering what we have here I rate this product a 5 stars.

       "    \"This dock accepts your regular laptops power supply through USB C and then can provide power to your laptop up to 60w which is more than enough for most laptops other than some recent Macbook Pros which go as high as 90w.On the other hand, if you need to charge this, you can do it in reverse and charge this dock buy supplying power to it using the laptop as the power source. This is the special feature for this dock since you don't need it's own individual power source to send the laptop output to your peripherals.If you are looking at this, you probably know the difference between a regular USB C and a Thunderbolt. The most important factor to me is that Thunderbolt 3 can power a pair of 4K displays at higher refresh rates such as 60hz while a regular USB C maxes out at 30fps.Being a software engineer who has 3 different workstation at home these days with more than 5-6 different displays at time, I am playing with different docking stations and have the chance of testing all of them during these tough work from home Covid times.The Core is relatively small but has a USB A 2.0, a USB A 3.2 Gen 2, a USB C, a DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2, Ethernet and a 3.5 mm audio.Overall for its bus powered internal engine and the features it has specially the nice 60w passthough capacity, this is an excellent dock. It's small footprint and small overall size makes it perfectly portable. Since it's dual powered it is one of the first single cable docking solution that I've seen recently and I love it. The improvements I can think of is getting rid of the USB A 2.0 which is useless these days, adding a few more USB Cs and certainly increasing the 60w wattage to 90w or more.

The only thing to keep in mind is that there are no HDMI ports on this dock but has 2 DisplayPort ports. This dock is a bit pricey but it does have a quality build.

       "    'Depending on the machine, USB-C interface, and the firmware revision of your machine, you\\'ll either love it or be frustrated by it. The fact that this is so touchy with respect to USB-C compatibility removes one of the stars. With the right machine, assuming up-to-date firmware, this is a godsend that outperforms most other comparable devices. On the other hand, if your USB-C connection isn\\'t \"up to snuff,\" you\\'ll likely spend hours searching for and (if you\\'re lucky) finding the correct firmware to allow your machine to utilize this device. Working in the computer industry, I know how time consuming and frustrating this can be. Even switching from one \"generation\" to the next can cause unbelievable frustration...Pros: Stellar performance, easy to utilize, and virtually worry-free performance.Cons: Very finnicky, with USB-C. Absolutely demands specific firmware.I do recommend it, but not to people unfamiliar with firmware or the \"not-so-technically\" inclined.Once the correct firmware is installed, I doubt there will be issues, going forward. However, be prepared to have to spend time \"tinkering.\" Also, be aware that this is intended for use with Thunderbolt 3. It\\'s the compatibility with USB-C (more widely adopted) that is an issue, not the performance of the device, itself. I only removed the star because if a manufacturer is going to make a device that is \"compatible\" with other interfaces, it is my opinion that the manufacturer assumes accountability for said compatibility issues, and should be prepared to provide guidance for less experienced users of technology.',\n",
       "    '[ For the TB 3 Dock Core ]The dock works out of the box without any hitches on my setup. The single upstream port carries video and USB, allowing quick switching between laptop / desktop. However the \"core\" version is severely limited.It is priced similarly to my\\xa0\\n\\nDell WD19\\n\\n  , so I will compare against that.The major difference is of course, this one uses the Thunderbolt 3 technology over the regular type-C of the older one. This allows video passthru at higher rates. For example, I could only get 1440p @ 60 Hz on Dell, but I can get 144 Hz on Belkin. This is a definite plus on Belkin side.The second difference is the power adapters. Dell came with a rather bulky one (at 180W), while Belkin asks to provide your own. And it only supports up to 60W, which is rather limiting for high performance laptops.The bottleneck is the upstream connector. Dell has a rather thicker, and longer one. However Belkin provided a very short and thin cable, which cannot carry more than that.And finally the number of ports is a bit low. There are only two USB ports, and the type-C power port does not seem to pass data. (i.e.: cannot \\'daisy chain\\'). My current setup needs three, and that is something I did not realize before requesting this product. Dell provides three regular USB, and two type-C USB ports, which provided better coverage.Overall if you just need two ports (and no easy future expansion), and 60W would be sufficient, this is an adequate device. If you plan for future expansion, you might want to look at the higher models.',\n",

It is properly detected as a Thunderbolt device.  Although the XPS requires more than 60W, the power from a separate 87W adapter passes through fine.  My wife is not a power user, so her computing activities are never likely to go over that 60W limit.Two minor complaints I have about this:1.  The permanently attached Thunderbolt cable is quite short.  This is fine for on-the-go or temporary docking scenarios, but when leaving it at a desk and connecting the laptop as needed it makes for a sloppy setup.2.  The USB input port is on the side - it should be in the back.  Chances are your power source is going to come from the back of your computing location, and this makes it unsightly and somewhat challenging to route cables.  I know space was limited in this form factor, but this thing is similar in size to an Intel NUC - which is a full computer - and all of its ports manage to be on the back.Overall, for a \"dock on the go\" type of solution, this fits the bill.  But if you\\'re going to leave it in place and connect your laptop as needed, I would look elsewhere.',\n",

External displays, USB devices, gigabit ethernet, no issues. I also didn\\'t have any issue with adequate power delivery (PD). I think that the people that are using the Macbook Pro 13\" may be encountering issues because the stock USB-C power brick for that unit is only 61w; the 15\" uses the 87w brick. The Belkin is only rated to provide PD at 60w, so that may not be enough \"oomph\" for the smaller output power adapter when combined.My only wish is that there was a Displayport over USB-C model available (or that I\\'d paid attention to the logic board specs on the Dell 5200 when I ordered it). For what it\\'s worth, the HP USB-C G5 dock works perfectly with the Dell, although that\\'s a little out of the scope of this review.I did not have to access technical support to use this device. It\\'s driverless and pretty much \"what you see is what you get.\" And if what you need is a Thunderbolt 3 dock that\\'s not the monster that say a Caldigit TB3 is - not to mention its monster price tag - I think you\\'ll be happy with this one.',\n",
       "    'I\\'ve tested out many of these docks at this point in time (especially since the work at home orders) and this dock provides a top tier \"ultimate\" experience for those of us who have laptops that can take advantage of it (more on that in a second).The ability to power multiple monitors (especially a 4k or 5k monitor, or multiple 4k monitors) means that a laptop essentially becomes a desktop.I tested this dock with a few different laptops with varying results.In testing with my Chromebook4 (what I am writing this review from); I was only able to drive one monitor at 1080p (it was showing 4k but didn\\'t seem to want to display, might be due to the chrome OS). The second monitor wouldn\\'t show up but this is a basic chromebook so.... considering the dock costs as much as this laptop; I am not expecting a dual 4k workstation out of it.Secondly I tested it with my GPD Pocket; I was able to get 1 4K monitor at 30hz or two 1080p monitors at 60hz (provided the laptop was closed and the internal monitor was off, otherwise just one monitor worked).Then I tested it with my phone and was able to get 1 monitor working at 4K 60hz (but the scaling was messed up) and other monitor didn\\'t show up at all.Lastly I tested with my Zenbook Pro Duo and I was able to get 2x 4K 60hz monitors working without a problem.I didn\\'t bother testing with my AMD powered Acer Nitro because I know that it doesn\\'t support video output via USB-C and therefore it makes a dock like this kind of useless.With all the laptops I tested I was able to use keyboard and mouse and wired ethernet without a problem (including with my phone) but not all laptops will be able to be powered via USB-C also (zenbook pro duo) so I would have to also use the power brick with that laptop. However with my other 2 laptops it is just a single connection and you get everything at once.If you have a laptop like this (most higher end laptops can do it all); then a dock like this gives you a 1-connection solution for turning your laptop into a desktop. If you haven\\'t used a real keyboard with your laptop then you don\\'t know what you are missing out. The experience is just like that of a high end desktop (provided you have a good keyboard of course) and a dock like this allows you to have just one computer that you can do everything with.The ability to have a 1 wire connection is really what does it for me; of course you can have multiple desktops (I do because I am a developer) but to be able to have a workstation where i can sit down and plug in a laptop and work on it as if its a desktop is a great thing. This dock does cost almost as much as a cheap desktop tower; but you won\\'t get the same performance out of a cheap tower and its yet another computer that you will have to manage. I think that this dock does everything right in the case of what you would want in a high end dock.All in all this is a great dock that just works out of the box as long as you have a laptop that works with it. Just be sure to check for thunderbolt support on your machine before you try to use it. If you don\\'t have thunderbolt support it may still work but have limited function (like my phone or chromebook). If your laptop doesn\\'t support video output via USB-C then this dock isn\\'t for you as that is the main feature of it.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!',\n",
       "    'I am technologically behind as technology moves faster and faster. I keep finding it hard to keep up, but I have found that many items that back 20 years ago might have plugged into the wall outlet now use USB plugs into laptops and also now some electric cord extensions have a USB ports as well to charge up some as well as the conventional plugs. So to get this docking item, helps to get the right things plugged in and to make it easier to transfer files from one type of disc unto another. My husband is the one that tries to keep track of these so that we have the technology when we need it. My desktop computer tower only has two USB ports in the front with one being used for the keyboard and one being used for the mouse. Hubby claims that in the back of it is more USB slots which are rather worthless to us unless we are contortionists and sure am not! So for use to download pictures from out camera, we have to have this to plus into the tower and then use its slots to make for more slots to plug the different items into.I do appreciate the opportunity to try this and review it. It comes in very handy!',\n",
       "    'This dock from belkin is great for allowing you to have desktop, dual display setup, taking up only one Thunderbolt 3 port on your computer. Docks like these speak to how powerful Thunderbolt 3 is, it’s pretty crazy that you can drive 2x 4K displays @60Hz and receive 60 watt Power Delivery back to your laptop, as well as still have the bandwidth for 2x USB 3.0 ports, and Gigabit Ethernet and it’s all happening over one cable to your computer. This is not the most port heavy dock around, it’s designed to be smaller and compact to fit in you bag. The dock has a built in Thunderbolt 3 cable, which is great, because one of those cables can be upwards of $30-$40 from a reputable brand like belkin. You can use your laptop charger by plugging it into the dock, assuming that your Thunderbolt 3 laptop does use USB C Power Delivery charging.The build quality of this dock is plastic but it feels sturdy and high quality to me. I think it will hold up well in you laptop bag or at home on your computer desk. Belkin makes excellent quality hardware, so I’m confident in this dock and it’s ability to last you a long time.Edit: I wanted to update the review to mention that the USB A ports on this dock are USB 3.1 gen 2, so you get a full 10Gbps instead of the 5 Gbps of USB 3.0 (USB 3.1 gen 1).',\n",
       "    'Belkin has a solid offering with this dock for those who trade connectivity options for thinness in laptops, traditional or 2-in-1s.  The most significant feature about this dock may be the massive power brick (135W) which should cover most (if not all) laptops with a unified Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) port. My laptop is fairly low in power needs and the 60W demand for charging is merely worth a smirk by the Belkin dock.Connecting two 4K displays is no problem either, provided you can deal with the display port outputs and don’t require hdmi. The latter is not provided by the dock. Of course many budget laptops don’t serve two 4K displays well, but if your computer can, the Belkin dock will support you, too.There is no shortage of USB ports. So you end up turning a single Thunderbolt 3 port (of your laptop) into display ports, an Ethernet port and two each of USB-A and USB-C ports. That should meet most needs and is quite commendable. What is missing, besides the hdmi outputs, is any type of Emory card reader. Personally, I’d love to see a CF card slot and the omnipresent SD port, but neither is in this device.This is clearly not a device for traveling and more a home station for road warriors that need a bit more connectivity when at the home base. Portability is a strong argument for the trend of reducing ports in the wake of shaving size and weight. The dock is a good compromise even if the USB-C format is not as convenient as dedicated docks where a laptop typically just sits on.The design is a nice mix of different surface finishes. It’s subtle and restrained to ensure you won’t get bored of it in a matter of weeks or months.',\n",
       "    \"GOOD: Received this right before the COVID-19 outbreak that forced everyone to work from home and it has been an absolute Godsend for both my wife (Windows laptop) and myself (Macbook Pro). It has almost everything you need for a full setup from home (2 Displayports, 1 Ethernet, 2 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C) so plenty of USB ports. The setup is dead simple as all I needed to do was plug and play with my current monitors and it absolutely beats having to carry around and connect 3-4 different dongles on my Macbook to set it up with my monitors, keyboard and mouse. Finally, love that it charges my Macbook so no need to plug in a charger and a dock so just one cable into my laptop gets the job done. I can triple monitor by leaving my Macbook open on a stand as well.BAD: Not much to complain about here but a few things that are slightly annoying. First, the Thunderbolt cable that connects your dock to the laptop is in the front of the dock rather than the side or back, which makes positioning the dock very awkward and if you like to keep your desk neat like me, may drive you nuts. The cable is simply not long enough to loop it around the back or hide it so the dock ends up needing to be close to your laptop. Secondly, once you plug in your mouse, keyboard and a hard drive, you find that you've completely run out of USB-A ports. 1-2 more here would have been excellent though I have since moved to wireless / bluetooth so I have eliminated that problem. Lastly, the dock is not super heavy so it does move around a bit so find a good place know you're going to keep it then don't expect to have much mobility once you place your dock on your desk.\",\n",
       "    \"I was looking for a way to use my Dell XPS 15 (9550) with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  This is the perfect solution.  In the past, I had used Dell laptops that were compatible with docking stations.This is the equivalent of a docking station.  It is nice that it has 2 HDMI ports.  One USB 3.0, one USB 2.0 and an ethernet port.Even better, the monitor that I used for another computer, that connects with DVI knows to switch to the HDMI when I plug in my laptop.  (that is more a feature of the monitor though)When I first plugged it in, the Thunderbolt software came up with a prompt and installed some drivers.  I really didn't have to do much, just click OK to let it update.The device is nice looking.  The outside is a single piece of aluminum.  The ends are a shiny black plastic material.  The cord is 6 inches long and of course, the connector is a USB C Thunderbolt connector.I have no complaints.  It does what I need it to do.  No lag on the screen or any ill effects of using the device.\",\n",
       "    \"Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus w/ 2.6ft Thunderbolt 3 Cable-Belkin did well with this docking station.  It is fairly simple to use and is on the compact side.  The one thing that’s not so compact is the power cable.  It’s almost identical to an average laptop charger cord.  I mention that because I know a big use of this product is for traveling.  I do see why it’s such a large cord as it allows multiple products to be running all at once through this.As far as the functionality goes, this product worked well.  I wish it had an HDMI direct connection but it’s easy enough to get an adapter for that.  The dual display ports will work to get two monitors connected.  I would just make sure you don’t need additional cords as not all monitors have direct display port connections. Newer monitors should all have this but I brought this to work and several of the monitors at my office would need the HDMI connection to work.  So I am just using display port to HDMI cables.  I do like the USB 3.0 ports on the device.  Transfer speeds seem to be as quick or quicker than I anticipated.Overall this is a solid docking station.  It’s fast and allows for quite a bit of functionality.  Transfer speeds are quick.  The image quality of the connected monitors is great.  The price point seems accurate for a docking station like this.  It boils down to how much use a person will get out of this product.  For me having the ability to multiply my work monitors is huge as well as the fast transfer speeds.  I also trust Belkin's products as I’ve had a number of them over the years.\",\n",
       "    \"This is a very well-made and designed docking station. The one that I have does not have an SD card slot/input as the picture but it does have 2 DisplayPorts, 2 USB-C ports, ethernet (Gigabit), 2 USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3.0 port. There is also a Kensington lock slot (which considering how much this puppy runs, it might be a good idea to use it). My monitors are actually not DisplayPort but I am able to connect to them via an adapter. My monitors are not 4K 60Hz but rather 1080P. Nonetheless, this works very well, my peripherals are VERY much faster than the other dock I was using, and this has made things quite a bit neater. Also, I love the fact I can use it with Windows 10 (as I am now for work) or with a Mac...as I am considering investing in one. The USB-C ports work very well and while the power delivery cannot power my laptop by itself, I am not worried about but rather am focused on the improvement that I have seen with external hard drives and the monitors themselves. I had a much cheaper dock before (in every sense of the word) and I found that my monitors (dual) would sometimes lock up or sort of freeze (force stop maybe?) and it always happened at the most inopportune times...conference calls or video calls...times I was sharing a screen. This is really what I needed all along because I cannot afford to sacrifice speed for economy. For my personal computer, no worries but for work, I must have something that works well and does not impede progress. This dock is it.Setup was fairly simple...One cable going to the dock from the computer and the rest from the dock. My monitors are newer and did not give me any issues.Functionality is great for the monitors and USB ports but I have not tried the ethernet port (so I cannot comment on its efficacy).Pros:Setup is simple if you have ThunderboltCan possibly power your laptop via the power delivery systemHas the capability to do 4K at 60Hz (although I don't know a lot of people with laptops that can power that much for anything game related)Gigabit ethernetMade wellWorks with Windows and MacCons:Is not cheapIs not cheap (listed twice to emphasize the point)Overall, if you require speed and cannot afford to be slowed down at inopportune times (conference calls, collaborations, video conferences), I highly recommend checking something like this out...along with other options and making the decision that fits your situation best. This is definitely an investment and not one to be taken lightly.\",\n",
       "    \"All I want is a dock that requires little to no set-up and just gets the job done and the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Plus gets this job done very very well.From the get-go, it comes in a small, hassle-free cardboard box that opens right up and includes the dock, charging cable and the thunderbolt cable that connects to your laptop (took me about 30 seconds total). All other wires you need to provide yourself. But once I set that up and plugged all my cables in, I had my set-up up and running within a few minutes. Overall the dock is super powerful and the main power source provides enough power to power all the usb outlets (great for portable storage). I use my 2 display ports for dual 4k monitors and running those with my macbook screen open as a third monitor is a breeze. The inclusion of both USB-A and C are inclusions as my keyboard and mouse take up the 2 USB-A slots in the back and the C's are taken up by portable hard drives and a cable for my phones. The final front USB-A is good for jumpdrives.The only reason I docked this 1 star was for an almost $300 dock, I found myself frustrated by the lack of total outlets (2 usb-c in the back + 2 usb-a in the back, and 1 usb-a in the front). Given that most of my outlets are almost always in use, it was slightly annoying to have to unplug one thing in order to plug something else in (like a pair of surround sound usb-headphones). Final slight annoyance is the thunderbolt cable port that connects to your laptop is in the front of the dock, which makes is strange since the cable connects to the side of your laptop. I would have much preferred to have this come out the side.\",\n",

It doesn't really get much better than this. It made up for the loss of my 2 USB's that were blown to bits by another item I was testing and I was happy to have them back and that sealed the deal for me. 4 BIG stars.*If this review helped you make an informed choice about this product in any way I would appreciate it if you take a moment of your time and let me know by hitting the Helpful button and letting me know.

       "    \"I have a tried a lot of docks for my Mac and this is the price range for one with good performance.The first test I perform on these is a the port speed test by comparing the performance of a peripheral connected to the dock against it connected directly to the laptop.My Samsung X5 drive which performs at about 2300 MB/s write and 2800 MB/s read performed at about 92% when connected to this dock via the Thunderbolt 3 port. I use Blackmagic to measure the speedsUsing an external mechanical 7200 RPM drive connected via USB 3.0 performed at about 87%.Another test I perform is to qualitatively test latency with a USB mouse. I put the dongle on the dock and test the mouse reaction. In most docking stations the mouse gets jumping and lacks smooth motion. But with this dock it was perfectly smooth. This indicates there is minimal (or none at all) latency between the port transfers.I was able to test one 4K monitor connected (and was active) while performing all other tests. No issues there.Charging works as expected.I am giving this docking station 4 stars for two reasons:1. The provided Thunderbolt 3 cable used to connect the computer is too short. 2.3 ft seems long, but it really isn't. This is a standard-length cable for most docking devices but there is at least one device on the market that is similar in price, features and performance and it provides a longer cable. I like to have my dock off to the side and out of the way.2. The drive performance takes just a little more of a hit than I think it should.Overall, this is a good dock and probably better than most.\",\n",

Luckily my monitor has dual display port inputs because this dock has no HDMI support but does have dual DP.  For my use case, I don't need both DPs on the dock since I'm only hooking up one monitor but dual DP does seem rare and if you want to drive dual monitor from your MacBook this is one of the fewer docks out there that will allow that.  For my use case I would have preferred one HDMI and one DP as HDMI is more common to find as inputs on monitors.  I also have found the network connection to be reliable so I don't have to worry about Wifi when I'm docked.  I also get full power charging to the MacBook.Dislikes:The power brick is huge and the box itself is just cheap plastic.  Since it's somewhat expected to live close to your pretty MacBook, it would have been nice if Belkin would have made the case out of aluminum.

The fact that I maintain transfer speeds of 40Gbps with the Thunderbolt 3 is a life saver, all while charging my MBP 15” with the 85w charger, mirroring it onto my 4K display.

And their Thunderbolt 3 dock doesn't disappoint. First of all, this is a beast. It is absolutely portable, but the form factor is large and heavier that most people would like lugging around in a laptop sleeve. If you are in the market for a Thunderbolt 3 dock, you likely aren't looking to have it with you all the time - like working remotely in a coffee shop or on the train. I use mine primarily in my home office to connect 2 monitors, my laptop, wireless optical mouse and keyboard, and an external hard drive. I keep the cords velcro tied to clean up the mess of having cables run everywhere. And everything fits nicely at the rear of my desk, out of the way of my immediate working area. And there is no noticeable overheating with this dock as some reviewers have mentioned for other manufacturers. All in all this is great doc albeit expensive. But if you have invested in a laptop that supports Thunderbolt 3 peripherals, you may not be too turned off by the high price.\",\n",

In my case, the logo on one of my laptops indicated it had a different type of USB-C port than it really has- despite the logos being \"standardized\" in the industry. Some frustration there, but because of the laptop manufacturer and the constantly evolving standards. In the end, this adapter still works on both laptops anyway- but if you have an early USB-C version there may be some limitations. Check carefully.',\n",

Belkin's website suggested that it would work. It works, but with a catch.First, this works flawlessly as a dock with my MacBook. I'm running one 1440p screen with a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapter, and a second 1080p screen with a DisplayPort -> DVI adapter, and a keyboard and mouse running from the USB ports.I connected my old desktop to the dock with a standard USB-C-to-USB-C cable, and it worked as a USB hub for the keyboard/mouse I had attached (no video, I have the desktop connected to separate inputs on the monitor). That worked perfectly, too.I just replaced the desktop with a new desktop, and the dock initially didn't want to behave as a USB hub. It would detect that something was plugged in, but would eventually error out saying there was a problem with the device when connected. I replaced the USB-C-to-USB-C cable I was using with the old desktop with a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C cable, and that seems to work okay. I'm not sure why the new machine wasn't playing nice with the old cable.One small nit - the listing claims the included Thunderbolt cable is 2.6ft, but mine is only 18-inches. The cable is also quite stiff. Unless you've got enough desk space to place your laptop right next to the dock, I'd invest in a longer, braided Thunderbolt cable that you can tuck out of the way.\",\n",

Some of that is due to the various bits needed to assure a good video signal, provide clean charging and other stuff, but much is the Thunderbolt tax.  Anything with the word Thunderbolt in the description (this can work with some USB C devices) tends to cost much more.

Which is specifically bad if I leave my laptop and it sleeps in an hour, it’s a time bomb to take down my network.Belkin then says it’s just an inconvenience, and can I prove to them I bought it recently by sending a photo of the hardware and a copy of my receipt, like maybe they won’t take me seriously with a huge known issue otherwise.I’m sending it back.  I’d rather deal with another company and see if they care more about not putting out a bad product than making their customers prove why they should be taken care of.',\n",
       "    \"I bought a cheaper thunderbolt for my MacBook Pro when I got it a year back because not many manufacturers were making these at that time. And then came this dock from Belkin, a company for which I have high regard in terms of electronics peripherals. It’s is a little expensive (one may be able to buy a decent computer for that price ;) But it's worth the. Price for at least a Macbook owner (can’t say for Windows because I don’t own one).First off, this dock has a nice feel to it and it's designed to save space and maximize utility. The best part is that it has the most commonly used ports (a headphone jack, USB3, USB-C, and SD card) in the front so that you don’t have to try and reach the back to use these ports. And it has a lot of ports in the back as well to connect multiple devices. It also has an ethernet port for connecting to wired internet. I was surprised to see a display port as well.And the bonus is that it can charge my MacBook also and at the same speed at the original charger. Plus I can now keep the original charger at home and use the dock at work.\",\n",
       "    \"I've always like Belkin products.  After getting a gaming laptop recently with USB-C, I've been looking for a dock to get rid of the jumble of cables I have to connect each time I want to work or game (see picture).  The Dell dock that is offered for my laptop had such bad reviews, problems with reliability, that I didn't want the hassle.  I also bought a gaming monitor that supports 165Hz and also upgraded my laptop screen to support 120Hz.  With this higher rate, Display port is the only way to go to support that speed and luckily this dock only has 2 display port slots.  On the other hand, if you're using HDMI, this is not going to be the dock for you without some sort of converter.  Quality is great as is the construction.  It includes a surprisingly short USB-C cable.  Mostly importantly, it worked right out of the box.  I'm pretty technical and the only thing that I haven't encountered before is you need to provide permission for the dock/peripherals to access your computer which was fairly easy - there is a pop-up, go the screen, select allow all access.  Very pleased with lack of clutter and ease of set-up, see after picture.\",\n",
       "    \"Belkin is one of those companies which you can rely on for excellent performance at a fair price.  This item is firmly in that tradition,My current laptop is very much in the current fashion. It has a card reader, a power connector, a USB-C port, and that's it. I have become an unwilling connoisseur of hubs and docking stations. This is one of the best I've found that doesn't have its own power supply. With two USB ports I can use keyboard, mouse, and another peripheral. Even though our home has WiFi it's nice that the unit provides decently fast Ethernet capabilities. And it really can handle two 4K monitors. It's honestly better with one 4K and one 1920x1080.It's a solid, dependable, high-performance product.\",\n",

This Mini Dock w/Thunderbolt 3 is a perfect example.It works great with the MacBookPro. I like how small and compact it is yet fully capable. It is a solid piece of gear that doesn't move around on the desk by the flex of the cables. It has enough heft and mass of its own combined with rubber feel to stay put. The ports are arranged in a logical layout. It works good in a rear jack with the ports facing to the rear. That way everything stays nice and tidy. Then when you need to travel with your laptop, it is a simple one cable and power supply unplug and you're ready to go. 5 stars.\",\n",

While the price is not low, it is the lowest-priced item I've seen which supports dual 4K@60Hz through HDMI. Physically, the hub feels high quality, much better than the sub-$50 dongles all over Amazon.Some people have mentioned USB not working, but that is because in some systems you need to change the Thunderbolt 3 security settings you have in you BIOS for that to work.I was able to get the displays and USB ports to work 100% fine in a Lenovo Carbon X1 v6 using Linux (after a change in the BIOS TB3 security settings) and a Dell XPS 13 9360 using Windows 10 (which worked out of the box).Only thing that would be a noticeable improvement IMO would be for it to have power delivery.Edit: I tried the included ethernet adapter and it works perfectly well.

One thing you may want to check the first time you connect the dock is the sound settings in macOS, because the audio chip in the dock will take over right away. I couldn't figure out why my Zoom sessions weren't working correctly, until I realized it was because the dock was taking over the sound and plugging a headset directly into the MacBook wasn't working.

       "    'Edit: Updated from 4 starts to 2 stars due to unreliable (flaky) GigabitEthernet port. On my 360 Mbps Internet connection, SpeedTest shows between 35 Mbps and 360 Mbps. I tested with an Apple Thunderbolt2-to-GigabitEthernet adapter daisy-chained to the Apple Thunderbolt3-to-Thunderbolt2 adapter, and I got consistent download speeds of 350-360 Mbps to the same server on the same Ethernet cable. My conclusion is that the Ethernet port is quite unreliable on this dock. Unplugging and re-plugging the dock into the Thunderbolt3 port on the MacBook Pro fixes the speed issue, but then it recurs. So, I had to return the dock.********************************************************************************************************************************This dock is powered by the USB-C port on the dock from any USB-C power supply. If you monitor has USB-C PD, you can plug it in the USB-C port on the dock. However, be aware that the dock can\\'t send video to the monitor via the USB-C port. The two ports that can send video signal to the monitor are: DP1.4 and HDMI2.0.DP1.4 is a real deal on this dock. If your 5K (or 8K) monitor can receive 5K via one port, and if your MacBook Pro supports DP1.4 in one stream (true only for 15\" and 16\" MacBook Pros since 2018, for 2020 13\" MacBook Air, and for 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with 10th generation CPU), you can connect your monitor to this dock with one DP1.4 cable and send 5K @60Hz to the monitor. The picture is gorgeous. The monitor goes to sleep and wakes up properly while connected to this dock with a DP cable. I haven\\'t tried the HDMI port on this dock.If your laptop is is 2016-2017 15\" MacBook Pro or 2016-2020 13\" MacBook Pro (with the 8th generation CPU), or the 2018-2019 MacBook Air, you can\\'t send 5K out of this dock to the monitor because you need to tile two DP1.2 signal with two DP cables to the monitor, and this dock only has one DP port. The HDMI2.0 port doesn\\'t support 5K (you need HDMI 2.1), so you are stuck with 4K @60Hz if you want to use the HDMI port. Like I mentioned above, the USB-C port on this dock is only for connected a USB-C power source, so you can\\'t send any video to a monitor out of the USB-C port on the dock.The DAC on the dock is decent and very similar to the DAC on the MacBook Pro in the sound quality. The dock\\'s DAC is connected to the computer via the Thunderbolt3 port as a USB2 device. When the external speakers are connected to the headphone jack on the dock they sound very similar to the way the same external speakers sound when connected to the headphone jack on the MacBook Pro.Both USB-A ports on the dock provide USB3 speed. I plugged in a USB3.0 flash drive into each port, and the drive got mounted as a USB3 device on both USB-A ports on the dock.When I connect a 45W USB-C power source to the USB-C port on the dock, it signals 30W to the MacBook Pro (20V x 1.5A). When the same power source is connected directly to a Thunderbolt3 on the MacBook Pro, the power source signals 45W to the MacBook Pro (20V x 2.25A). You can check what your power source signals to your Mac by using the command: \"pmset -g ac\" (without quotes) in macOS Terminal. I don\\'t think this dock consumes 15W of power, but it certainly \"reserves\" 15W for itself and cuts the passthrough power of the external power source by 15W.When I put the MacBook Pro to sleep, the dock remains powered. In other words, the dock doesn\\'t go into the sleep mode, which I think is as downside of the dock.I\\'ve read others complain about the dock getting too hot, but so far for me it\\'s barely warm.Now, instead of my MacBook Pro looking like a spider with cables sticking out of each port, I now have one Thunderbolt3 port with the cable connected to this dock. So, if I need to take my MacBook Pro off my desk, all I have to do is to disconnect one cable.',\n",
       "    \"It is unclear to me why, but as soon as I plug in the dock my laptop (Dell XPS 9310) starts heating up so much that the fans become intolerably loud - even when no monitor is connected or when the dock isn't being used to for powder delivery! This continues even when the laptop is shut. And even though the dock does what it's supposed to, this makes its use very annoying.On a sidenote for people that didn't read all the specs (like me): This does not come with a charger, you will need to purchase a 60+ Watt charger separately.\",\n",

       "    \"This Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro is an excellent solution for today's computers that need docks and dongles for just about everything. I'm using this with a Mac Mini and it works perfectly without any drivers or setup required. A Thunderbolt 3 cable is included, which is part of the reason for the price tag, because quality Thunderbolt cables aren't cheap.The build quality of this is excellent, with a perfectly machined aluminum body and a smooth shiny plastic front/back panel. It's perfectly reliable and has never dropped any connection with the display or peripherals. It has a bunch of useful ports, including an extra Thunderbolt 3 port on the back, a USB-C 3.1 gen 2 port on the front, ethernet, audio in/out, SD card slot, and a bunch of USB 3.0 ports. It has a DisplayPort connector instead of an HDMI port. If your monitor doesn't have a DisplayPort connector, you can always get a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter, or DisplayPort to MiniDisplayPort, or whatever your monitor might need. You can also drive a display from the Thunderbolt or USB-C ports.There's a little light on the front that is orange when the computer is disconnected or asleep, and green as soon as the computer is on and connected. There's no on/off switch on this dock, so if you want to power it off you just have to unplug it. I only unplug it if I'm not going to be using it for an extended period, otherwise I just leave it in standby mode so it's ready to go whenever I turn on my computer.I just got a Dell laptop that runs Windows and has a Thunderbolt 3 port, so I tested this dock out with it and it works perfectly, just like it does with my Mac - the first time I plugged it in, Windows installed some drivers silently in the background and it was up and running in about 10 seconds. The dock charges the laptop at full charging capacity, which is great.Keep in mind this is strictly a Thunderbolt 3 dock - if you don't have a Thunderbolt 3 port on your computer, it won't work. USB-C uses the same connector so it can be confusing. If you don't see a little lightning bolt symbol next to your USB-C port, it's not Thunderbolt. My Dell laptop has one Thunderbolt 3 port and one USB-C port so I have to make sure to plug it into the Thunderbolt 3 port, otherwise it won't work.I love that I can switch this between my Mac and PC, and it lets me use an external monitor and a bunch of other connections. I'm only using one monitor with it right now but it can drive two 4K displays (or one 5K display). If you have a computer with a Thunderbolt 3 port, this Belkin dock is an excellent accessory. Highly recommended.\",\n",

The fact that I maintain transfer speeds of 40Gbps with the Thunderbolt 3 is a life saver, all while charging my MBP 15” with the 85w charger, mirroring it onto my 4K display. I feel like I don’t maximize this dock to it’s fullest potential, simply because my needs are much less than what this dock can do!

       "    \"I just wished I have believed the other negative reviews saying that the second DisplayPort connection didn't work. I thought they were not knowing what they were doing trying wrong cables or having a weak hardware. Those things can totally influence the results. I have a collection of different cables to try and also different monitors and different laptops. I tried all possible combinations to make sure that that port is actually problematic. It is not just one or two units. The second DisplayPort is indeed broken by design. Every single unit is going to behave the same way.I was actually able to make it work but the solution is hacky as hell and defeats the purpose of having a dock station. Here are my findings:All tests have a thunderbolt3 enabled laptop connected to the dock with the provided thunderbolt3 cable at the right port (the one in the front).Test1 with MBP152019 (works)dock connections: one 4k monitor connected to the first DisplayPort (closer to Power connector)---------Test2 with MBP152019  (works)dock connections: one 4k monitor connected to the second DisplayPort---------Test3 with MBP152019  (doesn't work)dock connections: two 4k monitors connected to the DisplayPorts. Second screen is blankSo.. After those 3 simple tests my conclusion was that as the second DisplayPort alone worked perfectly at 60hz, the problem was just happening when both ports were used simultaneously. Then I decided to trick the internal dock board a bit out of curiosity.This is what I did in the following order:1. Disconnect the laptop from the dock2. Connect *just one* 4k monitor to the *second* DisplayPort (the left one looking from behind)3. Connect the laptop to the dock station and the monitor works normally at 60hz4. Connect the other 4k monitor to the *first* DisplayPort (the right one looking from behind)Voila! Everything worked as expected. At this point you have two 4k monitors working independently (no mirror) at 60hz. Of course this defeats the purpose of having a dock if I have to repeat all those steps every time the laptop sleeps.I repeated all the tests described above several times and the result was always the same. This is how I concluded that this model has actually an internal design problem and Im pretty sure that every single unit is going to behave exactly the same way. It is sad because it had a lot of potential! I really wanted to like this model as it had the limit price point I was decided to spend. I returned the unit and payed decided to pay the extra dollar to get the Elgato dock that I already knew it worked. Shame on the engineering team and management behind this project.

I really do not notice it.  Port selection is very good especially if your new laptop does not come with a full SD card slot.  Overall, I am very happy with this docking station.One note on ports, Belkin is not doing themselves a favour by being unclear about the DisplayPort version.  Based on the maximum resolution / refresh rate it has to be a DisplayPort 1.4.  Which you need for a 1440p 144Hz with 10 bit colour depth monitor (ie. HBR3).  Most other docking stations use DisplayPort 1.2.  There are not too many docking stations with a DisplayPort 1.4 or a Titan Ridge TB3 controller.  If you are spending the money on a large fancy monitor, make sure to get the DisplayPort version that matches the one on your monitor or better.For Dell users, The XPS 15 does complain that the charger is 'slow' which is only because it doesn't have Dell's excessive 130W proprietary adapter installed.  85W is more than sufficient and is properly identified as 85W in the BIOS.\",\n",

It’s a modest, matt black little square with two (fairly bright) LED lights on it, and it looks quite smart and professional.It works well and does what it ought. From my test Macbook I can happily drive a triple-monitor set-up- the laptop’s own monitor plus the DP and HDMI outputs from this, both of which handle my monitor’s maximum resolutions- which chugs along nicely with no apparent processor struggles or blips. I can run my ethernet connection through it and be reading files from a USB drive through it at the same time, and it just ticks along elegantly with no apparent problems and no sense of slowdown. I’ve run it for several hours straight in this set-up and it gets gently warm but I certainly wouldn’t describe it as overheating.The cable from the dock to the laptop is really quite short, just over 20cm, which will suit some desk arrangements more than others. I can store the dock underneath my laptop stand and have the cable curve round and connect with my laptop on top, which is quite a neat solution which hides a lot of cables (until the laptop’s removed)- but it’s quite tight and there’s not a lot of spare. Other people may well find they prefer to add a little USB-C extension cable into the equation to give a bit more flexibility. It’s hard-wired at the dock end so it has to be an extension, not a replacement.With cable connections on all four sides of the box, it’s quite a difficult box to arrange in an organised fashion, and simply plugging cables into it makes it look instantly messy, if that’s the kind of thing that bothers you. The Plus and Pro have a longer thinner layout with cables mostly on two sides, and that intuitively feels a bit neater. But if you have no concerns about cable management, and many don’t, then the compact size of the Core dock becomes a virtue.I want to give Belkin extra credit for the fully recyclable packaging as well. Tech manufacturers (including Belkin in the past) have often used excessive plastic showy packaging, shop-style packaging, even for online orders where the customer doesn’t need it- so I was pleasantly surprised to see Belkin are shipping these in sturdy cardboard. A big improvement.Some of the other reviews on this product seem to indicate that Belkin have had to revisit and revamp this product after initially making something that had problems.

       "    'Si necesitas conectar dos pantallas 4k desde un portátil o mac compatible con la tecnología de transferencia thunderbolt 3 este adaptador te va a servir para ello mismo y hay distintas variantes. En el caso de la core necesitas un cable hdmi para un monitor y uno display port para el otro.En cambio, si necesitas conectar solo una pantalla o quieres un adaptador con un puerto ethernet y algunos otros usb para conectar periféricos este no te interesará porque los hay mucho más económicos en dicho caso.Belkin Thunderbolt 3 CorePUNTOS A FAVOR+ Permite 2 pantallas 4k a 60hz.+ Los dos puertos usb son 3.1PUNTOS EN CONTRA- Si conectas dos monitores debes usar dos cables distintos, hdmi y displayport.- La presentación de la caja muy cutre.COMPARACIONESMini vs CoreLos dos llevan la misma cantidad de puertos, pero la versión mini en vez de llevar un displayport tiene solo hdmi y ambos puertos usb son versiones anteriores usb 3.0 y usb 2.0 a diferencia de los dos usb 3.1 que lleva la variante core.Core vs PlusEl plus añade un puerto usb 3.1 y otro usb c más con respecto a la versión core y, además, ahora ambos puertos de salida para los monitores son displayport. La versión plus es más recomendable si necesitas conectar más de dos periféricos.Plus vs ProLa versión top (pro) como diferencia principal es que permite una mayor salida de 85w con respecto a las demás variantes de 60w.Otra característica que cambia son los dos puertos usb c que mientras en la versión plus eran 3.2 en este caso son thunderbolt 3 permitiendo la máxima transferencia, en uno de los cuales se aconseja el uso para la carga del portátil y el otro para los periféricos como bien puede ser una pantalla 4k (si se conecta una más iría al puerto displayport).En cuanto a los puertos usb-a el Pro tiene 5 (cuatro de 3.0 y uno de 3.1) con respecto al Plus que lleva solo 3 de 3.1.Otra característica que le diferencia al Pro con respecto a las demás variantes es el hecho de incluir un lector de tarjetas sd, pero por otro lado su tamaño también es el mayor de todos.CONCLUSIÓNDicho esto, las 4 variantes Belkin Dock tienen una característica importante en común: admitir la conexión simultánea de dos pantallas 4k a 60hz y en lo que se distingue cada versión es básicamente en la cantidad de puertos y sus tecnologías para conectar periféricos.Nota: las comparaciones las hice basándome en la información que hay en esta pagina, por lo que no descarto haberme equivocado en alguna parte. La versión que me mandaron es la core.Un saludo y un muy buen día.',\n",
       "    'En mi caso, debo especificar que el modelo testeado por mi, ha sido el Thunderbolt 3 CORE, empezar diciendo que el resultado ha sido completamente el esperado y para lo que decidí adquirirlo, 0 problemas desde el minuto 1, conexión total probado tanto en Mac como en PC, repito sin absolutamente ningún problema.Lo que he conseguido con este dispositivo es multiplicar los puertos de mi portátil, ya que, al teletrabajar desde casa, en la oficina, ya tengo DockStation, necesitaba exactamente esto, poder dejar conectados todos los dispositivos para llegar, enchufar y listo.He conectado dos pantallas con HDMI y otro cable de DisplayPort a HDMI, sin ningún problema, las dos funcionando perfectamente, le enganche el cable de Red, ratón y teclado inalámbrico y los altavoces, junto con una webcam para las conference y el resultado no ha podido ser más exitoso.Además, aun dispongo de un puerto USB-C por si necesitara conectar cualquier dispositivo o incluso otro HUB que me otorgue mas puertos si los necesitase.En resumen, un producto de marca reconocida, muy TOP, eso sí…a un precio poco asequible y al alcance no de todo el mundo supongo.',\n",
       "    'Desde que, a raíz de la pandemia, la mayoría del tiempo teletrabajo desde casa, me he dado cuenta que mi portátil no tiene bastantes puertos para todos los periféricos que necesito tener conectados (ratón, impresora, tableta gráfica, disco duro externo, monitor, ...).Me he estado apañando con un HUB usb, pero me daba muchos problemas, tenía que bajar los hertzios en mi monitor, si conectaba demasiados periféricos al hub se colgaban por falta de suministro eléctrico, la transferencia de datos súper lenta, ...Al tener la oportunidad de probar este base dock de Belkin, no he perdido la oportunidad, eso sí... después de haber comprobado que mi portátil tenía conexión Thunderbolt, ese es un requisito esencial.La base dock consta de 2 puertos USB-A 3.1, puerto USB-C PD, puerto Display Port 1.4, puerto HDMI 2.0, puerto Jack audio y puerto Gigabit Ethernet, además, claro, del cable Thunderbolt que se conecta al portátil.Una de las diferencias más destacadas entre este thunderbolt 3 y un HUB USB tradicional (y la que a mi me ha convencido de la excelencia de este sistema) es que el HUB USB solo puede soportar un monitor 4k a 30HZ, en cambio este Dock Thunderbolt 3 es capaz de soportar 2 pantallas 4K a 60HZ de manera simultánea o un monitor 8K a 30HZ.Puede suministrar una corriente de hasta 60W (suficiente para alimentar al mismo tiempo varios dispositivos sin cargador independiente), claro, esta carga saldrá de nuestro portátil, por lo que hay que asegurarse que la fuente de alimentación a que lo tengamos conectado, de suficiente carga, o el Dock drenara nuestra batería en poco tiempo.Tiene una tasa de transferencia de 40 Gbps, por lo que tiene suficiente capacidad para soportar varios periféricos funcionando a la vez sin experimentar retrasos en la transferencia de datos.Por supuesto es compatible con equipos Windows y Mac, el único requisito es que el equipo soporte thunderbolt.En definitiva... Un dispositivo esencial si teletrabajas en casa y usas al mismo tiempo varios periféricos o más de 1 monitor.',\n",
       "    'Das Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock arbeitet sowohl mit meinem Windowsrechner, als auch mit dem Macbook 12\" einwandfrei zusammen.Die Verarbeitung wirkt sehr hochwertig und auch optisch ist es schlicht, aber schön.An Anschlüssen werden Displayport 1.4, HDMI 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, USB-C PD Anschluss, integrierter Thunderbolt 3 Kabel, Audioanschluss und 2x USB-A 3.1 geboten.Auch ein Setup mit 2x 4K-Monitor konnte ich damit bürotauglich und gamingtauglich (mit der Einschränkung auf 60Hz) bespielen.Insgesamt stellt das Dock eine gute Möglichkeit da um insbesondere das Notebook/Macbook mal schnell anzudocken und gleichzeitig zu laden (bis 60W).Prinzipiell gibt es nicht viel zu kritisieren, allerdings ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis dann doch etwas schwächer. Man bekommt ähnliche Adapter, die vielleicht etwas weniger hochwertig erscheinen mögen, schon für weniger als die Hälfte des hier aufgerufenen Preises. Für den Standardnutzer ist dieses Dock mit Thunderbolt 3 und hochwertiger Verarbeitung also fast etwas \"oversized\".Gleichwohl gefällt es mir fürs Home Office und wird dort definitiv Verwendung finden.',\n",

       "    'La technologie Thunderbolt 3 s’est démocratisée ces dernières années avec l’arrivée de notebooks de plus en plus dépourvus en matière de connectique. Elle permet, à partir d’une seule sortie TB3 sous la forme d’un simple connecteur USB-C, de recharger son portable, de gérer plusieurs affichages sur des moniteurs externes, de brancher des périphériques USB, d’acheminer de l’audio, et même d’apporter une prise Ethernet. En somme, vous n’avez qu’une seule prise à brancher sur votre portable lorsque vous le posez sur votre bureau pour un usage sédentaire. Car c’est bien d’un usage sédentaire que l’on parle. Les docks TB3 ne doivent pas être confondus avec les classiques dongles USB-C, pratiques et portables, mais beaucoup plus limités.Avec ce modèle Dock Core, Belkin propose le modèle le plus simple de sa nouvelle gamme, si l’on excepte le modèle Mini, incapable de recharger l’ordinateur. Pour un usage complet de ce produit, il vous faudra l’alimenter avec un chargeur d’au moins 60W,  non présent dans la boîte. Ceux fournis avec les MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13 pouces récents ou encore des PC tels les Dell XPS 13 conviendront parfaitement. Vous pourrez aussi utiliser des chargeurs plus puissants comme ceux fournis sur les modèles 15 ou 16 pouces de chez Apple, mais avec une limitation importante : la recharge ne dépassera pas 60W, ce qui ne permettra pas de recharger efficacement votre ordinateur en usage intensif. A l’usage, ce dock est donc à réserver aux modèles dépourvus de cartes graphiques dédiées, qui sont souvent les modèles 13 ou 14 pouces des fabricants les plus connus.Utilisé sur Mac, le dock est parfaitement reconnu. Sans être relié au secteur, il est en déjà en mesure de faire fonctionner les ports USB ainsi que l’entrée-sortie audio. En revanche, les sorties HDMI et DisplayPort ainsi que le port Ethernet réclament obligatoirement de brancher le dock au secteur. Je n’ai rencontré aucun problème d’affichage avec mon écran 4K relié à la prise DisplayPort, et l’affichage sur ma TV 4K via la prise HDMI a été parfaitement pris en charge aussi.Avec une connexion internet à 1Gb/s, j’ai tenté de pousser au maximum le débit de la prise Ethernet. J’ai pu obtenir un débit proche de 850Mb/s, soit une perte d’environ 10% par rapport à une carte réseau sur un mon PC fixe, un résultat parfaitement conforme aux attentes.Au rayon des regrets, je note le fait que le câble à relier à l’ordinateur soit serti au dock, j’aurais préféré un câble détachable. Avec le prix demandé par Belkin, la fourniture d’un chargeur secteur aurait été aussi bienvenue (là, ça fait quand même un peu pingre !).Au final, ce produit remplit parfaitement son rôle et la compatibilité étendue aux PC est une excellente nouvelle. Si vous êtes équipé d’un portable dont l’alimentation ne dépasse pas 60W et que vous avez l’habitude de le brancher à un écran et d’autres équipements à la maison, il vous apportera un grand confort d’usage et vous satisfera donc pleinement.',\n",

       "    'Pros:Works over ThunderBolt3 with HP Spectre 15\" & MacBook Pro 2016+. Dual display worked with U3011 2K@60Hz DP-DP, LG 27GL850-B 2K USBC-DP, and VGA, using left-sided DisplayPort is plugged in, and rear-right-side USBC port.Cons:- Buggy: HP\\'s dock firmware upgrade causes BSOD on Win10 1909. HP Support is unreachable.- Buggy: I tried 7 cables compatible on the CalDigit TS3+, 5 failed on the G2; full DP cable in left slot + right USBC worked. TB3 port failed to daisy-chain to the TS3+ TB3 dock and fails with most cables too.- Bad design: Top panel (1/6th of the unit!) is a power button that cannot be disabled, you will shut down often, accidentally. The dock has its own fan and low CPU activity activates the laptop fan even when not charging.- Bad on MacOS: TS3+ @ 85W works immediately, G2 @ 100W only has no ethernet, no audio, no dual-display on Catalina; yet both work in Bootcamp Win 10 1809 on MBP 2016+.- Vendor lockin: TS3+ is more reliable and versatile in all but one case: HP 15\" charges on HP G2, but HP\\'s Windows Notifications ask for power cable with TS3+ under moderate CPU load.Conclusion:For an HP 15\", or if for $50 you\\'re willing to live with bugs, buy the G2.For anything else get a CalDigit TS3+ (refurbished, on holidays for 15% less).',\n",

The first is that the USB ports don't currently work for my keyboard and mouse.  I have to plug those into the laptop.  It's looking like a firmware update is going to be needed to solve that problem, though it's odd that the USB ports don't work... seems like primary functionality.Anyway, the second problem is that the whole top of the thing is a power button that works instantly.  When I put my hand on it to hold it still to plug or unplug devices, it toggles the power of the laptop.  A normal desktop power button has to be held for 10 seconds or so to shut down power that directly.  This sensitive power button on the whole top of the device is the dumbest design for a computer peripheral I've ever seen.  It's exactly wrong.  Super easy to mistakenly hit, and powers the device down immediately instead of going through normal shut down standards.With a firmware update it probably works very well and is a worthwhile device.

Sometimes, you plug it in, and boom you are in. Other times, you plug it in, and maybe one of the following happens:- One or both monitors just dont turn on- USB devices dont work- Ethernet doesnt work- Laptop crashesUsually, i have to unplug everything, power down, replug everything, power back up, then it all works. Hot swapping between devices seems to be particularly awful and has caused me a ton of headaches.If you are just using this for one device and you aren't likely to be unplugging/replugging multiple times a day, This will probably work out for you, but you might wanna research some more reliable options for your specific hardware.

Very occasionally it doesn't connect properly to the external monitors -- unplug and re-plug usually fixed that. Once I had an issue with windows network drivers; cycling the power on the docking station resolved it.Downside is that the top surface is the power button, and is very sensitive. I try to place the dock as far away from me as possible because many times I have powered down my laptop just brushing my hand over the dock. Moving the dock is tricky since the obvious move is to grab it from the top, but doing so is nearly guaranteed to toggle the power switch. So you have to grab it from the side, which is awkward because it is too wide to grip easily and too short to grip safely without a finger toughing the power button.So, it works but due to the power button issue I don't recommend it if you have limited space or clutter on your desk, or if you frequently plug/plugin things into the dock. If your desk is neat and tidy and you plan to use this as your power switch then you'll probably find it to be elegant.\",\n",

       "    'Meine Voraussetzungen und mein Ziel sind: HP Spectre 360 Notebook von Ende 2019 und problemloses Umschalten zwischen diesem (Firmen)Notebook und meinem Standrechner in meinem Homeoffice.Ich habe zuerst Abstand genommen von dieser Docking Station, da einige geschrieben haben, dass darin ein lauter Lüfter laufen würde und dass es Probleme gäbe mehr als einen Monitor anzuschließen. Also habe ich zuerst das G5 Dock von HP gekauft um dann festzustellen, dass man damit keinen 4k Monitor mit 60 Hz betreiben kann. Danach habe ich noch eines von Dell und eines von Wavlink getestet. Mit keinem ist es mir gelungen mein Setup zufriedenstellend zu betreiben.Mit dem G2 Dock (120 Watt) funktioniert das Wichtigste und meine Erwartungen waren eh schon sehr zurückhaltend.1. Es gibt gar keinen lauten Lüfter! Ich vermute, dass dies nur die 230 Watt Version betrifft und dass die Rezensionen einfach vermischt wurden unter den unterschiedlichen Versionen was leider immer wieder der Fall ist bei diversen Produkten. Aber das ist wie gesagt nur eine Vermutung. Ich habe jedenfalls noch absolut kein Geräusch vernommen von dem Dock.2. Das wichtigste war für mich, dass mein 4k Monitor mit 60Hz einwandfrei und ohne irgendwelche Verzögerungen oder Ruckler funktioniert und das tut er! Angeschlossen habe ich ihn mit einem USB-C Thunderbolt auf HDMI 2.0 Kabel und am Display Port Eingang des Monitors ist mein Standrechner angeschlossen.3. Weiters ist ein Full-HD Monitor via Display Port auf HDMI Adapter angeschlossen und auch das funktioniert einwandfrei. Das heißt ich habe den 4k Laptop Monitor, meinen 4k Hauptbildschirm und einen Full HD Monitor problemlos in Betrieb und damit kann ich ganz gut arbeiten.4. Beim Versuch einen weiteren Monitor via VGA anzuschließen, verlor ich den Ausgang zum 4k Hauptbildschirm. Also alle Ausgänge kann man offensichtlich nicht zugleich verwenden. Ob es funktioniert hätte, wenn ich den zweiten Display Port Ausgang verwendet hätte, konnte ich mangels Adapter nicht testen.EDIT: Man kann sämtliche Kombinationen der Ausgänge nutzen, allerdings kann die Grafikkarte im Notebook nicht mehr als drei Displays ansteuern. Da heißt das interne Display plus zwei externe Displays, oder nur drei externe Displays (nicht ausprobiert).5. Alle USB-Geräte funktionieren einwandfrei und ohne Aussetzer (leider nicht selbstverständlich wie ich bei anderen Docks feststellen musste). Das heißt ich kann mein externes Audio-Interface, meine mechanische, beleuchtete Tastatur, usw. problemlos mittels USB-Switch mit Standrechner und Dock (Notebook) verbinden. Das Umschalten am Switch funktioniert einwandfrei.6. Das Laden des Notebooks funktioniert ebenso einwandfrei.Fazit: Ich habe in meinem kleinen Homeoffice, welches zugleich so eine Art Studio ist, ca. 60-70 Kabel verlegt und bin froh nun endlich eine Lösung gefunden zu haben um mein Firmen-Notebook mit nur einem Kabel an die wichtigsten Geräte anzuschließen und zugleich laden zu können. Insofern ist es verglichen mit anderen Geräten nicht nur das einzige, dass alle meine Erwartungen erfüllt hat, sondern auch preislich noch einigermaßen im Rahmen. Einen Stern ziehe ich ab, weil es wie bei den meisten Artikeln leider schwierig war im Voraus anhand exakter Spezifikationen heraus zu finden was das Teil nun wirklich kann und ob es irgendwelche Geräusche macht oder nicht.',\n",

Der Laptop mit dem ich dies getestet habe (mein Arbeitslaptop) ist ein Dell Precision 5520 mit Nvidia Quadro M1200 und der Intel i7-7820HQ (mit Intel HD Graphics 630).Nun zur Dock. Zuerst die positiven Aspekte:* Die Dock ist (zum Kaufzeitpunkt) ziemlich günstig im Vergleich zur Konkurrenz.* Auch wenn sie aus Plastik ist wirkt sie nicht billig, und viel wichtiger hat sie ein gutes Gewicht sodass sie sich nicht ständig verrutschen wird.* mir fehlt da wieder der Vergleich, aber sie scheint nicht allzu groß und hat dennoch eine gute Anzahl an PortsNun zu den Gründen für die vergleichsweise schlechte Bewertung :* Ich habe diese Dock nun während des Winters getestet, und da ich spät heimkomme und nicht gerne Energie verschwende, ist mein Zimmer zurzeit nur minimal geheizt. Dennoch laufen bei der Dock regelmäßig die Lüfter gut hörbar an. Und das auch wenn man den Laptop ausgeschaltet hat und nur auflädt. Bei dieser Temperatur, und in anbetracht dessen das die Dock sowieso einen separaten Trafo hat, ist das für mich nicht akzeptabel. Davon abgesehen das ich nicht weiß wie dieses Szenario zu einem solchen Energieverbrauch in der doch selbst führt, wirft es auch einen gewissen Schatten auf das Kühlkonzept. Die Dock hat nur kleine Lufteinlass-Schlitze üben und unten, kein Wunder das der Lüfter stark laufen muss. Vielleicht würde versucht die Dock angenehmer zum anfassen zu machen mit der Plastikverkleidung, aber mir wahren offene Kühlrippen lieber als ein lauter Lüfter, insbesondere im anbetracht das es im Sommer wohl noch wesentlich schlimmer kommen könnte und ich nicht weiß ob die kühlung da die notwendigen Kapazitäten hat.* wie in den englischen Reviews erwähnt hatte ich Probleme mehr als einen Monitor zum laufen zu bekommen. Ich habe einen 2560x1440@144Hz Bildschirm, aber was auch immer ich als bildwiederholfrequenz einstelle, und ob ich meinen zweiten Bildschirm, einen alten 1920x1080@60Hz per VGA anschließe oder den 2ten DisplayPort Anschluss auf den HDMI Anschluss meines Displays adaptiere, der 2te Monitor wird zwar erkannt, aber zeigt kein Bild. Dieser ist an, die richtige Quelle ausgewählt, und funktioniert über HDMI.Ich bin nicht mehr dazu gekommen den Netzwerkanschluss zu testen, aber die USB Anschlüsse passen.

       "    'Die Bewertungen, die ich hier über das G2 Thunderbolt 3-Dock gelesen habe, waren zugegeben etwas durchwachsen. Einige bemängeln den zu lauten Lüfter. Ich war mir nicht sicher, ob das Dock an einem MacBook Pro mit den neuen M1-Prozessoren (vorgestellt im November 2020) funktioniert.Mein Resümee nach einigen Tagen: Es arbeitet erstaunlich problemlos. Der Lüfter ist mit bloßem Ohr kaum hörbar. Nur wenn man sein Ohr direkt an die Lüftungsschlitze auf der Rückseite des Gerätes hält, hört man den Lüfter leise drehen. Alles in allem nicht störend.Das wichtigste an einem Dock ist, dass alle Ports funktionieren. Und das tun sie. Der Anschluß an das MacBook Pro gestaltet sich dank mitgelieferten und fest montiertem Thunderbolt 3-Kabel einfach (Länge ca. 0.7 Meter). Mit etwas handwerklichen Geschick ist es sogar auswechselbar, z.B. gegen ein längeres Kabel. Das Kabel kommt vorne aus dem Gehäuse heraus. Das finde ich nicht so optimal, wenn das Laptop neben dem Dock steht. Aber damit kann ich leben.Meinen USB-C-basierten Dell-Monitor kann ich entweder über den hinteren Thunderbolt 3- oder die USB-C-Buchse (mit DisplayPort-ALT-Unterstützung) anschließen, alternativ auch über einen aktiven DisplayPort-auf-HDMi-Adapter. Der Mac erkennt auch den im Dock integrierten Gigabit-Ethernet-Port (nach einem ersten Neustart, dann dauerhaft). Ebenso findet man unter MacOS eine weitere virtuelle Audio-Karte vor. Am Dock gibt es einen kombinierten 3.5 mm-Anschluss, das ein Headset vertragen soll (noch nicht selbst ausprobiert). Ein Kopfhörer funktioniert ebenfalls. Die übrigen USB-A- und C-Ports tun ebenfalls ihren Dienst, wobei hervorzuheben ist, dass die hinteren USB-C-Buchsen USB 3.1 Gen 2 unterstützen, d.h. 10 GBit/s - alternativ kann man auch an eine der beiden Buchsen ein weiteres Thunderbolt 3-Gerät anschließen, das sich dann allerdings die  Bandbreite mit dem Dock zu teilen hat.Interessant zu erwähnen ist, dass der Ein- und Ausschalt-Taster an der Oberseite des Gerätes nur mit HP-Geräten funktioniert und sonst funktionslos ist.Das Problem bei den neuen M1-basierten Macs ist, dass der Prozessor aktuell nur einen externen Monitor unterstützt. Das ist somit kein Problem des Docks, sondern des Apple Prozessor-Designs. Trotzdem gibt es in meinen Augen einen akzeptablen Workaround: Wer mehr als 1 externen Monitor anschließen möchte, sollte sich einen sog. \"DisplayLink\"-kompatiblen USB-Adapter besorgen. Diese Adapter gibt es von unterschiedlichen Anbietern und auch als 4K-Variante anschlossen. Mein Adapter stammt von CableMatters und ist 4K-fähig.Ein Ende des Adapters habe ich den zweiten Monitor via HDMI angeschlossen, das andere an einen der beiden USB-3-A-Ports an der Rückseite des Docks. Wenn man sich anschließend auf der DisplayLink-Webseite die neuesten Treiber für den Chipset besorgt (schon BigSur-kompatibel) und installiert, wird der Monitor korrekt erkannt.Bildschirminhalte werden dann komprimiert über USB zum Adapter übertragen. Eine zugegeben etwas ungewöhnliche Realisation, die relativ problemarm funktioniert. Man muss dich beim Betrieb des Adapters nur im Klaren sein, dass es nicht möglich ist, geschützte Inhalte wie Apple TV+ oder Netflix auf den Monitoren abzuspielen. Da der Treiber jedoch über die Menüleiste einfach deaktivierbar (und aktivierbar) ist, ist das kein großer Nachteil. Zudem erhöht der Betrieb aufgrund der notwendigen Komprimierung etwas die CPU-Last. Das ist aber nur dann der Fall, wenn sich der Bildschirminhalt auf dem jeweiligen DisplayLink-versorgten Monitor ändert. Zudem ist der M1-Prozessor so stark, dass die leicht erhöhte CPU-Last (bei mir ca. 5%) nicht negativ bemerkbar macht.Für mich stellt das HP G2 Thunderbolt-Dock eine preis-werte-Lösung dar, um auch aktuelle MacBooks mit einem leistungsfähigen Thunderbolt-3-Dock zu verbinden.',\n",

I have sent two support requests to Kensington who doesn't even acknowledge me which is likely due to the pandemic, but to warn fellow users the computer will not restart with the dock plugged in, rather it shuts down and will not restart back up until you hold the power button down for 15 seconds and then click it once more quickly and it starts up. This is major wear and tear on the button and sometimes when everything starts back up, I have to completely reconfigure my monitors as it erases my settings. Don't get this dock until they have squashed these bad bugs.\",\n",
       "    \"I tried upgrading from a SD5000T mainly to get the full-speed 96W charging, and to get both of my displays plugged into an integrated dock rather than needing an additional thunderbolt dongle. Sadly, even after one night of usage, my macbook would crash *constantly* when attached to this dock; when plugging in, when unplugging, when waking from sleep.  Even when it's not crashing my displays fail to light up about half of the time.Not going all the way down to 1 star here because this is almost certainly a software problem on Apple's end (the culprit, if you care about this sort of thing, is a double-free in the AMD radeon kext, which is reliably visible in the panic backtrace), but Kensington should have taken more care to actually test this against real devices before shipping it.I have not returned it yet but I plan to do so within the next day or two unless Kensington's support can work some kind of miracle; the tweaks they have suggested so far have made no difference.Update: I upgraded to Big Sur which some friends had suggested to me might contain some thunderbolt bugfixes, but it's no help. Kensington's support never returned my calls. Big disappointment; I've returned the dock now.\",\n",
       "    \"Since buying a MacBook pro last year, I have had trouble finding a device that will let me add 2 continuous monitors, have USB ports, have an ethernet port, and charges my computer so all I have do do is plug one thing in and go.  I tried many other items that cost around $100 like a j5.  Nothing worked.  My last device kept causing my computer to crash.  I thought it was the computer and found out it was the device drivers.  After updating to Catalina, the device didn't work and the company states it is working on drivers.  This device just works.  You pug it in and it works.  No downloading and installing drivers.  It comes with everything you need for two monitors via HDMI, has plenty of USB ports and has it's own charging system so you don't need to use the adapter that came with the device. (if your device supports thunderbolt).  Yes it is on the expensive side but again, it works.  It doesn't run hot like the other devices do . I was afraid to plug in my flash drive in fear it would damage the electronics because it was so hot.  It even has audio ports and a SD card slot.  It truly is a one shoe fits all device.  Mac's are quirky with third party items but this functions as though it was made by apple.  When you wake the computer form sleep, it takes a few seconds, sometimes 20 or more, for all the monitors to capture a signal so be patient.  I wish I purchased this last year and didn't waste my money on the other useless products out there.\",\n",
       "    \"The Kensington SD5300T dock offers more USB 2/3 ports than I'll ever need.  I bought this to use with my new Macbook Air and it's meeting my needs.  The included power supply allows me to leave my charger and cable elsewhere.  I would have liked to see an included USB-C to VGA adapter instead of the USB-C to HDMI that comes with it.  What sold me on this unit is the length of the Thunderbolt 3  connection cable.  It allows the dock to be placed away from the laptop and not take up valuable desk space.  Overall a good dock at an acceptable price.  Over the past few days I've come across a number of very similar looking docks.  This is the only one I recall offering the extra usb-c to hdmi adapter.  This dock also seems to have brought back to life a usb 3 drive that wasn't responding to my mac mini.  Overall, it has exceeded my expectations.\",\n",

This works great with my 2020 macbook air (intel) with thunderbolt 3 inputs. But it does NOT work with my old dell laptop with USB-C input (no thunderbolt). Then when I was confused, I saw an answer from Kensington USA on this page:\"...Thunderbolt 3 laptops will work with USB-C docks (at USB-C speeds), but USB-C laptops generally don\\'t work with Thunderbolt 3 docks. We do have one TB3 dock which is indeed backwards compatible with USB-C, our SD5500T. We also have three USB-C docks which are compatible with Thunderbolt 3, our SD2000P (single display), SD4700P, dual display, and SD4900P (triple display). Thanks!\"',\n",

The card reader is on the front as well as headphone jack and 2 more USB ports (one of them high power for charging).  Well though out placement of everything.  The build quality is excellent.  It's also heavy enough that it stays put with everything plugged in - this is more meant to be a docking station, not a portable ports box.  Completely happy with it.\",\n",

       "    \"I feel like this product did a really good job while I could use it.  I ran into a problem that's entirely Apple's fault - my MacBook just so happens to be the one model out of that entire year that can't do Thunderbolt.  If you don't have Thunderbolt explicitly stated on your MacBook specs, this will appear to work for a minute and then bomb out with a 'Thunderbolt is not supported on this Mac' message.That said, on a Thunderbolt connection it does exactly what it says it will do.  It's easy to set up, you get tons of connectors and good instructions, and given Apple's recent tendency to cut back on available ports on a MacBook, it's extremely useful to have multiple USB and video out ports.It's just a lot more expensive than most solutions.  I've used a QGeeM that does most of this and is a lot less, it just doesn't have its own power source but it's only got 7 ports.If you need a lot of ports and you'd like to hook up external monitors to your MacBook (and you absolutely have Thunderbolt and not 'pretend Thunderbolt over USB-C that doesn't actually work') then this is a really good product.\",\n",

The dock connects to an LG 34UM58P monitor via HDMI, an Ethernet cable, and a bunch of USB devices, including three connected through a 4-port hub. An audio system is connected to the headphone jack.

I still can\\'t figure out the difference between the 5300 and 5350 and which to get. the agents aren\\'t knowledgable on chat and a week later I still haven\\'t had my email answered. its very unclear what the pricing should be. dealing with them is the sole reason for \\'4\\' and not \\'5\\' star review and my biggest hesitancy in recommending the company- the dock does not function as a platform for the laptop, they need separate real estate on your desk/tableIn sum: if the price stays $200-$230, its a really good value.

       "    'Like a lot of professionals out there, I have two laptops and a wide range of peripherals that need to be connected to my working laptop. I have a Windows based PC I use for work and a MacBook Pro 2020 with Intel silicon for home. I purchased this dock station so I can leave all displays and peripherals connected and switch from one laptop to another by just switching the Thunderbolt cable. Well, with this docking station, this is not possible! Here are some very interesting observations:Observation 1) If I disconnect the dock from MacBook Pro and connect it again to the same laptop, some of the peripherals go offline. I have to power down the dock station, remove all the cables, power it up and connect the cables one at a time. Kensington customer support called it \"Bandwidth Prioritization\" which does not make any sense whatsoever. The most bandwidth hungry peripherals I have are the two monitors which are two exactly the same monitors at HD resolution!Observation 2) Once I get the docking station working again on MacBook Pro, If I disconnect the Thunderbolt cable and connect it to my Windows PC, everything hangs! Not even my laptop works! So, again, I have to disconnect all the cables, wait for 20 seconds and connect them back up one at a time.Observation 3) If the docking station is already connected to the Windows laptop and I reconnect it to the same laptop, I am back to observation 1!I wonder what the purpose of a docking station is, if I have to keep plugging and unplugging all the cables all the time!Observation 4) This device is strangely look very similar to Plugable TBT3-UDZ model. They both have the same specifications. I purchased Plugable dock to see if I get a better luck and I am glad I did. TBT3-UDZ has a bit of issues which is really a Mac OS problem. But other than that, it does everything I wanted Kensington Dock do at lesser price!I contacted Kensington customer support multiple times and went through their troubleshooting process. They insisted unplugging and plugging all cables is expected of this device. Then they sent me to their level 2 support which insisted that I need to replace my HDMI cables with active ones! Even though the requirement for active HDMI cable is when you need more than 10 ft of cable and mine are only 3 ft. Upon further back and forth, they promised to replicate the issue and get back to me. Well, I am still waiting!',\n",

All you need everyday is to connect the usb-c cable to your laptop and you are ready to go.The only cons is it limits to 2 monitors as there is only 1 HDMI and 1 USB-C (to HDMI adapter) ports for connecting monitors, so if someone is looking to connect 3 or more external monitors, this is not suitable for them.',\n",

They emailed me back with a list of things to try. I tried everything that was suggested but it did not fix the problem. So they told me to call them. When I did they told me a few other things to try. I tried those things and then the entire dock stopped working. Technical support said if those things didn't work I should just send it back and that's what I'm going to do.

       "   'content': ['I\\'m coming from a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Dock Gen 2 (say that one time slowly). The TBT3-Gen2 is pretty awful. I bought this Plugable product on a whim, hoping it would connect and disconnect without needing to do a rain dance. Read on.First, the video ports are DisplayPort. They are not HDMI. If your monitors do not have DisplayPort inputs, you\\'ll need a converter or adapter. Mine are HDMI. I bought two \"CalDigit DisplayPort 1.2 to HDMI 2.0 (DP to HDMI) Active Adapter 4K 60Hz UHD (3840 x 2160), Eyefinity Support\" adapters here on the Amazon.I unboxed the Plugable dock and got right to the plugging part. I plugged in the included 20V power supply, the two monitors (with adapters), then connected my Dell XPS 13 to the dock with the included Thunderbolt 3 cable.Results: Without installing any drivers or performing any magic incantations, the devices all connected and worked, for the most part. USB works great. The network port appeared and configured properly. And the monitors? That\\'s where the \"most part\" comes in.Both monitors are older ASUS VE278 27 inch 1080p. Both were horrendous when connected to the Lenovo dock. Horrendous means each time the computer suspended and resumed, the dock had to be unplugged and replugged a few times to get both monitors to reliably detect.With the Plugable dock, I have to occasionally unplug and replug the dock one time to get the right side monitor to reconnect. I haven\\'t contacted support yet, though I do see someone with a Macbook had a similar problem, and Plugable got right back to them. I have hopes. Even if it isn\\'t solved, the process is 10 seconds, not five minutes (yes, five real minutes) to get the Lenovo dock to work.Overall, I\\'m a fan. I\\'d recommend this product, and I\\'ll be buying another to use at my second workspace.',\n",
       "    \"Plugged the monitors, mouse, keyboard, a couple various USB 2.X and 3.X hubs (off of which are hanging various devices, like a sound card and a webcam) into the unit, plugged in a sleeping MacBook Pro (2019, 16 inch), and the displays lit up, the mouse works, the keyboard works, the sound card works, and the MacBook seems to be charging.  It's only been a few hours, so time will will have to tell if there are any problems, but so far so good.I am a Plugable fan.  Whenever I have to buy some weird USB thing or some hard disk enclosure or some bluetooth adapter or dock or whatever, I always try to see if Plugable makes what I'm looking for because a) in my experience, whatever they sell usually works under all operating systems.  b) if it doesn't, they take great pains to tell you in the description before you buy it.  I really appreciate their products.  Note that this particular unit does not really work under Linux (this isn't a problem for me; they don't say it does); on Ubuntu 18.04, the USB doesn't work, although the displays do.* EDIT... later, I hooked this up to a Lenovo Thinkpad P15 running both Windows and Ubuntu Linux 20.04.  Unsurprisingly it worked with Windows right out of the box (ethernet, displayport, USB, audio).  Surprisingly, it also worked with Ubuntu.  Under Linux, you have to use the NVIDIA proprietary drivers to drive an external displayport monitor, and I only tried one external monitor, but it drove a 4K monitor at 60Hz without issue.\",\n",
       "    'UPDATE: This product did not work for me but after talking with Plugable support I have learned a lot about the various types of USB-C and what is compatible with my devices.  I was very impressed with how the support team helped me return this product and get a model that does work with my devices.-----------------------Plugged this into my HP Elitebook 850 G3 and two ASUS 1080 monitors with no luck.  It installed as a USB Hub and USB Audio Device.  Then I tried with an ASUS Chromebook Flip with and it did not work their either.  I had high hopes for this device but was left disappointed.  I will probably have to start the return process.',\n",
       "    'I bought this to connect dual monitors and external devices to my new HP Spectra 360 with the thunderbolt port.  There could have been a lot more thought into the layout of the ports.  The power, monitor and hardwire internet are all on the front cables stick out front and get in the way when you try to plug devices into the USB ports.  My old UD-3900 was so much better.  I also have issues using dual monitors.  The first problem stemmed from my second monitor only has and HDMI plug in and want recognized with the display port adaptor I originally used. It took some research but I finally found that I needed to use an active HDMI to Device port adaptor.  It would be nice if that was in the instructions or product description so I could have ordered one when I ordered the docking station.  The most frustrating issue is probably not Pluggables problem but I wish the companies would address the problem  The HP has the Radeon video card and regularly reboots due to Wattman setting errors.  You would think that as long as this issue has been around manufactures would find a fix instead letting it go.',\n",

Then it goes out. Then it comes back on. I tried 2 different monitors and a number of different cords. It was all the same. The monitor goes out. Then it comes back on if I jiggle or open the laptop.I can plug the monitor directly into the laptop and it works perfectly, so it's not the cords or the monitor. It's the docking station. I tried everything and it didn't work. This thing is an absolute pile of junk. Couldn't return it fast enough.\",\n",

I have tried another docking station from TOTU and that one was unable to do that.The 1 star deduction is due to wake from standby issues exhibited by this docking station. Whenever I wake up my laptop (by opening the lid), the docking station is unable to detect one of my monitors. I have to unplug the USB-C cable from the the laptop and reinsert it to detect the 2nd monitor. Once I did this, both monitors are detected, but the a side effect is my existing windows/apps are all moved to the laptop screen and I have to move them back to the external monitors.',\n",

I could not get my two external displays to be recognized through the hub.  The manufacturer's technical support said 'wait for a new graphics card driver' when I tried to use their own hub.Fortunately, I returned their hub and bought a Plugable brand hub. Plugable technical support stuck with me, identified the problem and provided access to an appropriate video driver and provided the steps I needed to take achieve my goal -- extend the laptop's desktop across two external display all through one external hub.I cannot over-emphasize how pleased I am with Plugable, their products, and their willingness to support their customers.I highly endorse the Plugable brand.\",\n",

I think we both agreed that there was something in my system that just wasn't right. I finally decided not to buy the TBT3-UDV and instead try the newer TBT3-UDC1. I'm not sure what the difference is but the newer dock works perfectly. Plus, I prefer the size and the horizontal vs vertical orientation.I can only say that after my experience with the Plugable dock. I will remain a loyal user of Plugable gear.

Sometimes it's just best to stick with a manufacturer you know and trust instead of trying to find a cheaper device from an unknown company\",\n",

       "    \"Was looking for a solution to deal with swapping peripherals between my work (Macbook Pro) and personal (Asus Zephyrus M15) laptop without having to re-plug a billion different cables every day, and came across this dock which seemed to fit all my needs while looking clean and modern.The good:I have my keyboard, mouse, audio, and monitor (AOC 24G1, 1080p 144hz) running off it, and so far have not had any major issues and it has been a blessing not having to deal with swapping so many cables. The dock does get a bit warm during use, but nothing really concerning aside from it heating up my room a bit more. No extra drivers were needed on Windows 10 or Mac OS Catalina. HDCP content works correctly without the weird black screen flickering that I get on other usb-c hubs that prevents me from using the monitor for watching movies.The meh:Hot-plugging into the displayports sometimes doesn't trigger the monitor to be detected, and I need to re-plug the thunderbolt cable to get it to detect. However, if I don't touch the display cables, then things otherwise work smoothly. I was hoping that I would be able to use G-sync with my Freesync monitor finally, but unfortunately this dock doesn't seem to support it (no option in NVIDIA control panel), so gamers beware. Using the ethernet port on the dock compared to directly on my personal laptop causes a slight drop in my internet speeds, going from ~600 mbps down to ~450 mbps, so I opted to stick to directly plugging into my laptop instead. That said, topping out at ~450 mbps is still pretty acceptable compared to wifi.The bad (and I am REALLY annoyed by this, especially being the first impression I had of Plugable products):The product I received was clearly an open box (see photos); the seal on the box was obviously not its original seal. The box was bulging from incorrect packaging, one of the product review cards that should have been in the HDMI adapter pouch was outside in the main box, the plastic cover for the plug was not on the plug, and I don't know if there was supposed to be some cardboard at the bottom to hold the power adapter in place, but as you can see, it is able to just slide around inside. There are some very minor scruff marks on the dock itself that I also noticed, signs that someone tried to plug cables into the dock before. This is ABSOLUTELY unexceptionable when the product is marketed and priced as being brand new (this wasn't cheap...). I should have gotten an open-box discount for what I had received.I would have given the dock itself a 5 star, but with the open box issue I would have dropped it to a 1 (0?) star if it weren't for the fact that the dock itself is in fairly pristine condition and all of the functionality seems to be working.\",\n",

The provided HDMI converter worked wonderfully for the single display I was able to run. If I did not have an M1 Macbook, I would highly recommend this product.'],\n",

       "   'content': [\"Does it work? Technically, yes. It does turn one USB 3.0 port into two HDMI ports. In order to do so, however, you must install their driver software which is bloated, invasive, and generally crummy. It not only installs KERNEL LEVEL PRIVILEGES (are you kidding me?!), but it stab-murders your native graphics card's controls. ALL of them. Color controls: GONE; custom resolutions: GONE; timing control: GONE. Oh, and do you want to uninstall it? Prepare for a full OS clean install, because it sets permissions that disallow a regular old system restore from deleting it. Now, why on earth would a little dongle need to do that, exactly? I can't think of a single good reason for it. And I am definitely not going to just leave software with those permissions just floating around my machine - how do I know for sure it didn't grant itself permission to something else while it was at it? I don't. And THAT is completely unacceptable.\",\n",

Luckily I keep a backup of all of our payroll files just in case. Immediately after downloading the drivers per the installation instructions the software required upon completion to restart the computer. As soon as the computer restarted and just after the windows screen that pops up after the BIOS screen completes I was staring the blue screen of death. While it may seem like a simple way to expand your desktop to two monitors I assure you this is not the product to get you there. I ask you again DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!',\n",
       "    'My laptop only has 1 HDMI port, which meant that I could only add a single additional monitor.  I needed a USB adapter to add a second external monitor.  This little device did the trick.  Now I have 3 monitors (including the built-in monitor) and after some adjusting in Windows 10, I have 3 monitors that I can scroll across continuously left to right and have multiple windows open.  This is huge when I am working in Excel, PowerPoint and Chrome at the same time.  I can even stream videos and music from YouTube and work on the other screens.  Very good product.  Simple to use by downloading some software and following the instructions.  Takes just 5 minutes or so.',\n",
       "    'I love the extra screens. I am using this dual card in addition to a single card startech that I purchased last year on a usb3 hub to allow for 4 large screens and the laptop screen, which I rarely use. All ports are HDMI in this install. The important thing to do it configure the monitors, in display settings, so that the same monitor is always checked as the \"main display\" and all monitors are in the same position under all scenarios of activity - no matter how the monitors decide to fire and in what order. I am using a laptop that has a built in HDMI port, so I made this connection my main display for all cases. First, only hook up the main display. In display settings,  check the 2 monitor as the main display. Then add one of the startech adapters and configure it as if it is a partial install and make sure all of the monitors are in the same location you would expect and make #2 the main display again. Now unhook it and do the same with the other startech. Then make sure with all of your startechs loaded, the same location for each monitor is there and #2 is the main display. This fixed all my issues.. since the monitor may flake out for a second every once in a while or when the usb cable is moved, but since everything is in the same place under all conditions, it comes right back and does not freeze. I also have all the monitors powered into one power strip under the monitors and I cut the power to them when I am done for the day and leave the laptop in full power mode (no sleep) on all the time. You also want to make sure you have the latest driver update and that all of your startechs are running the same driver by updating them in Device Manager/Display adapters - right click on the adapter and choose Update Driver software. My old startech is called Trigger 6 and the new one is called MCT USB3.0. They both are running the same driver and work well together.',\n",

Windows 10 shows it I’m device manager, but it won’t output anything onto the monitors until you unplug and plug it back in.After dealing with it not being recognized you get a good quality image. The refresh rate is good and I don\\'t notice any difference from the other two NEC\\'s that come right off my laptop docking station. I haven\\'t tried to push 4K using it, but for 1920x1200 it works great.',\n",
       "    \"I saw one of the reviews below saying that copy/paste didn't work and I kinda rolled my eyes.  I'm a programmer and it doesn't make any sense that a USB video adapter would break copy/paste.Well, sure enough, it does.  Somehow, some way, when I am using this adapter, then copy/paste across remote desktop sporadically does not work.  It's not 100% of the time, but it's easily reproducible.  RDP to couple of machines, copy and paste things across the remote desktop session, and after a few times, it won't work any more.  Pull the plug on the adapter and it will immediately start working fine.I'm befuddled that such an obvious bug in the software exists.As for the quality, it's fine.  It's a bit sluggish for gaming, but if you're looking to use business applications, you're not going to notice it.  The only problem I have is with it breaking copy/paste.\",\n",
       "    \"I got this to use with my desktop computer so I can have two HDMI outputs from the same graphics card.  However, while waiting for a new card, I hooked this up to my Dell laptop and added the two monitors.  The monitors are capable of 2650 by 1440 resolution.  The laptop display can run at 3840 by 2160.Windows 10:  I downloaded the driver zip file and extracted it exactly as instructed and hooked up the two monitors to the StarTech device with HDMI cables.  Then I ran the driver executable and installed the driver.  Rebooted and plugged in the device.  The two monitors came up immediately.  I selected to extend them, put them in a left to right order with the laptop as the center display, and got three displays side by side with the ability to drag windows across between them.  However I noticed that the rightmost monitor was only displaying at 2048 by 1152 and not the full 2560 by 1440.  It seems that, although it can handle two monitors, there is a limitation on how many pixels it can handle.  I unplugged the HDMI port for that monitor from the device and plugged it into my laptop and was able to get the full resolution of 2650 by 1440 on both external monitors again.  So, the pixel limitation definitely appears to be in the StarTech and not in the graphics card on the laptop.  I suspect that, when I get the desktop graphics card, I will either need to run both displays at 2048 by 1132 or plug one of them into the card and one into the StarTech.  For me that is not a showstopper since my main issue was that most graphics cards don't offer two HDMI ports and this solves that problem while still allowing me the maximum resolution on my displays.But functionally it works perfectly and, for my needs, it will be just fine as I will either be happy with the lower resolution of 2048 by 1152 or, if I need 2650 by 1440 or higher, I will always have an HDMI port on the graphics card from my laptop or desktop.The display settings make it easy to put three monitors in whatever resolution, positioning, and scale/layout settings that I want.  Obviously, if displays are duplicated, then both displays get the same settings.  But, in extended mode, each one can be set to different settings.Note:  Since this simply presents the monitors to the graphics card in the computer and then transmits the output from the card to the monitors, it is not, in itself a graphics card and depends on the graphics card in the computer.  I'm not a gamer so I don't know about the performance with gaming graphics.  However, since the gaming video will be rendered completely by the graphics card in the computer, then the limitations will only be the latency and throughput of the USB 3.0 channel and the refresh frequency of the StartTech device.\",\n",

Pro's:  When you finally get it to work it's great!  Cons:  Instructions could be more detailed.  I'm pretty good with computers normally but I almost gave up on this.  The Intel Display Software on my Dell laptop would only recognize 1 display.  It wasn't until I just used the other display options that I actually could get it to work.  Then it was a snap.  Complete detailed instructions would have gotten this unit 6 stars.  :)UPDATE:  I stated above that it was the Intel software on my computer but, on 2nd thought, it was the monitors' software.  If you have 2 different display options try them both before you give up.UPDATE 6-21-19:  I just hooked this up to my work computer.  Definitely easier 2nd time around.  I followed the instructions.  1. Download drivers from StarTech website  2.  Let it restart my computer  3. plugged in the usb with the displays already connected  (main screen mirrored on all at this point)  4. Went to display options and extended the display.  Good to go!

       "    \"What Startech Really Doesn't want you to Know about their USB 3.0 to Dual HDMI AdapterI always leave a one star rating on an item to get your attention when there is something a potential buyer needs to know about a product. In this case the Startech USB 3.0 to Dual HDMI Adapter has two HDMI adapters but only one of them is 4k. I didn't know that when I bought the item and I was pretty disappointed because I have two extra 4k displays and I wanted to two additional 4k displays.I already had the Startech Single HDMI adapter. I bought it in 2018.  It worked fine with my 4k display.  I recently decided to add another 4k display so of course I purchased the USB 3.0 to Dual HDMI Adapter thinking it would have two 4k HDMI outputs.It doesn't.  Only one of the HDMI outputs is 4k. The second one is 1080 which of course looks awful on a 4k display. Startech is kind of cagey about this. They don't actually misrepresent their product but then again you have to hunt for this information. It seem to me Startech is perfectly fine with letting you think you are getting two 4k outputs from their device. You're not.Luckily I was able to plug in both the single HDMI Startech adapter I already had and also the new dual output adapter into two separate usb ports and get one 4k output from each of them so the problem is solved.However if you think you are buying a device with the USB 3.0 to Dual HDMI Adapter which has two 4k outputs you are mistaken and you will be disappointed.  If you need two additional 4k outputs, then I would try buying two of the Startech USB 3.0 to single HDMI Adapter and see if you can use them both simultaneously. You'll save money.BTW - I have not seen the blue screen of death that other one star reviewers are referring to. Most of the reviews seem to have been posted a couple of years ago. Maybe Startech upgraded their software to solve that problem because I didn't see that problem with my system.\",\n",

I set it up to have my external monitors extend from laptop (laptop is 1, external monitors being 2 and 3) going from left to right, respectively.Another cool feature is that when I close my laptop, one of the external monitors becomes the default screen 1 (laptop screen).

When plugged in, my night light or my CareUeyes app (reduces blue light) are not able to detect the two attached monitors. This is critical as the blue light can cause further damage and deterioration of my retinas. In order for my filters to work, the hdmi cable (from the screen) must be plugged directly into my computer and not the adapter to usb. This is unfortunate as I continuously re-adjust my app filters every hour to keep my eyes comfortable. It's a bigger PITA now because I have to adjust the screen brightness manually from the screen itself verses using an app. I'm sure there is a work around to this, but I am not tech savvy enough to figure it out.

I used it for about 30 minutes with my monitors before having to step away from the system for a few hours. When I came back my system had hibernated and appeared to not be able to wake up. After rebooting the system and finding the same issue I disconnected the only thing that had changed in my environment, the StarTech.com Slim USB 3.0 to HDMI adapter. The main monitor (directly connected to the system via HDMI) woke up and responded without issue. Once fully logged back into the OS (Windows 10) the second monitor (connected to this adapter) seemed to once again work fine. After a few minutes though there were once again issues. Any program or application window placed on the second monitor would, after a few minutes, be kicked over to the main monitor automatically at which point all monitors would flicker on an off with the second monitor staying out for a few moments. This happened repeatedly over the course of about 30 minutes. Once i removed the adapter from the USB port the issue stopped reoccurring. After doing a fair amount of research, including attempting to upgrade all drivers and software, i read through some more reviews here and found that others are having the same issues with this adapter. I have had this adapter connected and configured for less than a day and am returning it. Do not buy this adapter, look elsewhere.

I have a nice 5.1 system setup and had to go into windows and change the default back to my soundcard.  Again, not a huge issue but something to be noted for those who might not see this coming.The second thing to note about this adapter is it's designed for 2D and not 3D graphics.  Don't expect to be gaming on this adapter, it's best use is for a home / office setting.  I can stream 720 / 1080i graphical content on USB 3.0 without issues.

Shortly after purchasing I turned on my bluetooth and wifi to share some files with my friends in my home and the wifi would simply not connect.  Bluetooth also started to cut out intermittently and would disconnect and reconnect every few seconds which was very disruptive to work.

I then disconnected everything from my computer and turned ALL other devices off to figure out what was wrong. Turns out when I plug this product into my USB port it messes with the wifi signal and bluetooth (not very technical but this was 100% the problem). I even dealt with Verizon for 3 hours to try and make sure my settings on the router were all updated, which they were, took down my firewall entirely on everything in case that was it(didn\\'t make a difference).2) There is a occasionally a distortion of the image on the monitor this is connected to and it freezes as well.I kept it because I have my mac mini hooked up to a CAT 5e cable for internet service so I\\'m not worried about the wifi.If this is ever fixed with software updates I will let you know and change the 2/5 stars to reflect the change.

The only compromise is in not getting full rate (60Hz) 1920x1020 video.  This is because I am using USB2.0, not the preferred USB3.0.  I can still play full HD, but it is choppy due slower update rate.  Smaller video windows perform well.  This is as expected and as advertised by Startech.

Yes.I bought this product because I just built a new PC and I needed a dual monitor set up with a VGA converter. It had good reviews and seemed like the optimal idea. VGA to USB is kind of a strange conversion, but I went with it anyways. I installed the software plugged everything in, and it worked! After maybe a couple of days I finally began to notice the very shaky and jittery quality that this product offers when converting my display. I was disappointed in the quality but nonetheless I continued to use it.Now I'm a big gamer and my new PC is a high end gaming computer, with a GTX 1070 gpu, i5 processor, and 16gb of RAM. So I began questioning why my games wouldn't launch and began to become laggy. After a long time trying to fix these issues with customer support, gaming forums, reddit, and troubleshooting I finally pinpointed the problem - This product. Now my PC can run a dual monitor set up with very little trouble, but with this product my games became laggy and didn't function properly. I didn't expect that this would be a problem, and I believe that it's the software that this product comes with that is causing all these performance issues. After uninstalling the software and removing the product, my games began to run perfectly.If you NEED a product like this, buy it... otherwise you should do everything you can to avoid using this product.\",\n",

The adapters will occasionally just stop refreshing the screen, effectively freezing it until unplugged and plugged back in (which can turn into an adventure with Windows' fiddly multi-monitor support).  They get quite hot during use, so I wonder if inadequate cooling isn't at least partially to blame.They also don't fully allow monitors to go to sleep.  After turning my laptop off, the monitors attached to these will continue to cycle on and off unless individually powered down.  Disclaimer here -- I run 2 off of a powered USB hub, which *could* be part of the issue.  Still should not happen regardless though.One of them also has a bizarre rendering issue with red -- anything red on the screen attached to it appears pixelated.I'm usually a fan of StarTech, but this adapter really falls flat on it's face.  I've had a pair of older Plugable USB-DVI adapters for much longer that I've had zero issues with.  They're bulkier, especially with the DVI-HDMI adapter if you need HDMI out, but far more reliable: https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Graphics-Multiple-1920x1080-Chromebook/dp/B004AIJE9G/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1546979518&sr=8-3&keywords=plugable+usb+to+dvi+adapter\",\n",

The manufacturer sent me this device to review - this is my honest opinion.I have an HTPC that I have hooked up to my TV, and since the graphics card is a little older (and low profile) it only has a DVI port and a MiniDP port, no HDMI. Obviously, that's a little inconvenient, but I had been using a DVI to HDMI adapter without issue. Still, I love reviewing tech so I took StarTech up on their review offer. Once it arrived, I installed the drivers on the included CD and plugged the adapter into a USB 3.0 port, hooked up the HDMI cable and fired up my TV.Running from the USB 3.0 port from my HTPC, I have no problem with full HD videos playing. There's no lag, it requires no other power source and is a lot less inconvenient than running a DVI cable, which tend to be bulky and expensive for longer cables. Overall, it took a little working to get this all set up, but StarTech continues to impress me with their quality. I would love to see this come down $10 in price, but overall no problems recommending it.\",\n",

I have a gaming laptop(Predator Helios 300) with a GTX 1060 in it, but for some reason it only has a single HDMI video output port. It does have usb c, but doesn\\'t support video output, which I learned first by buying a usb c to HDMI adapter, and then when that didn\\'t work, finding that out through research online as well. So I was left with only usb 3.0 and 2.0 port to use. I use my laptop for AutoCAD work, which I do on a 24\" screen that utilizes the HDMI port. But I find that I always have youtube and some documents open and I hate having to stop what I\\'m working on to switch them if I need to. So I wanted a 2nd extended screen. Let me clarify, NOT a duplicated screen, and EXTENDED screen. I bought this after reading through review sites, and filtering out the ones that only certain sites said were good. This seems to be the one that they all said were reliable, functional, and would EXTEND my second external moniter.And it does!!! It\\'s awesome. I certainly wouldn\\'t use it for gaming because there is a very slight additional latency to it compared to the laptop and other external monitor, but for having a document open, browsing the web, even using youtube or netflix, it\\'s perfect.I was also concerned about the CPU load since that\\'s how these usb to HDMI dongles work, but I\\'m running an i7-7900 and I can\\'t even see any additional load on the CPU when I\\'m using it. If you have an older computer or laptop, there might be some performance penalty, but any system that\\'s 3-4 years old or newer, and isn\\'t a budget machine, should be more than fine.If your looking for something that will allow you to have a 2,3, or 4 monitor setup, this thing is fantastic.',\n",
       "    'Rarely am I motivated to provide feedback for Amazon purchases but I make an exception on this one. I chose this after my all-in-one PC’s integrated display adapter failed and I was reduced to using the external HDMI output for my primary display. This was a pain because I’m accustomed to working with two displays. I had tried other options like a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter that I have but response was pathetic, along with lower resolution.I was very apprehensive about whether this would actually live up to the hype, not to mention being wary about parting with anything beyond a tenner. My concerns were totally unfounded. The package was delivered lightning quick via Prime less than 24 hours after purchase. I am the type that doesn’t mess around with manuals or drivers so I plugged it into a USB 2.0 port to gauge the worst case scenario. To my surprise it worked flawlessly, easily matching the other identical monitor, which has max resolution of 2560x1440. I pitted the two monitors against each other running one of those 4K videos off YouTube and couldn’t notice any difference. Worth mentioning that the USB 3.0 port did not detect the device on Windows 10 at all until after I installed the drivers from the website. There was no noticeable difference so I’ve kept it plugged into the USB 2.0 port.I sense the CPU is working ever slightly harder because the cooling fan seems to have kicked into high gear a bit more than usual. I’ll need to confirm whether this is a real issue but it’s a negligible annoyance considering I’m back in business with the same setup I’d gotten used to.I should point out that only one of the HDMI ports on the device supports 4K, while the other is slightly lower. This is not an issue for me because I only needed the one, and the second is just a bonus. All in all, I am fully satisfied as it was clearly as described and solved my problem 100%. Of course there are cheaper alternatives but they only go up to 1080p. In an ideal world my computer would have a USB-C port and I could get away with a third of the price, but hey, such is life.',\n",

Either way, it has been working well so far. The quality is still not the same as a real graphics card HDMI port in terms of lag (I run an i7 laptop with 16 GB RAM, SSD, with two graphics cards - motherboard graphics + a separate 2 GB AMD Radeon graphics card as well), but it's very good for what I need it for (office work, studying, research, mostly - I need lots of desktop space, hence working with laptop+2 monitors).One of the reasons I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is that the driver doesn't interface with blue light filters (neither the built in Windows 10 blue light filter, neither with F.lux). I use two Dell UltraSharp U2419H monitors, which are really good quality and are kind to my eyes. The monitors come with software to let me control settings through Windows. Unfortunately, the adapter driver doesn't interface with that either and Windows can't detect that the monitor through the adapter is present, only the one connected to the laptop HDMI is detected.

Solo tengan cuidado con el driver (para Win10) de la pagina de StarTech, ya que cuando lo instalé, fue lo que averió el dispositivo que me reemplazaron; si tienen Win 10, no necesitan instalar nada adicional.En resumen, muy contento con el fabricante StarTech, y hay que decirlo, muy decepcionado de Amazon (aunque nunca antes me habían fallado).',\n",

But getting the drivers involves dealing with a security issue.BACKGROUND: I wanted to connect two 24\" monitors via HDMI to a laptop using this HDMI-to-USB B connector (without using USB C connector).This device works fine -- I\\'m using it right now, in fact. So far, no driver installation issues or crashes after a few minutes of usage. It\\'s doing what it\\'s supposed to do. My laptop runs Windows 10.My one-star deduction is because when trying to download the driver file, I encounter the server certificate error (using Chrome was my browser). It\\'s not cool to tell Chrome to download from an insecure server.',\n",
       "    'Used this with my linux laptop and my W10 laptop. Both laptops able to output video and record video using VLC. No drivers were required. Latency is pretty good, but box does get hot. Plug and play is a great thing about this little box.I did 1080p without an issue.',\n",
       "    'Works exactly as it should. Able to connect two monitors to my laptop and extend the view. Very happy.',\n",
       "    \"This product works well with my MacBook Air 2020 and my MacBook Pro Late-2013 models. Took a while to figure out that I need to start the DisplayLink Manager every time I want to set up my dual screen set up. I have it automatically started up every time I reboot my computer so that's not an issue. The prevailing issue now is that the monitors will forget the settings (background and/or resolution) it was last fitted through because of some software/hardware functionality that is driven by the DisplayLink softaware/hardware.\",\n",
       "    \"Drivers are easy to install with no issues in download/software. This product extends, not just duplicates your monitors and offers some decent resolutions. If you are rocking 1920/1080 monitors it's a plug and play thing. However for me I run both high end larger flat and curved monitors in the 2560x1440 and 2560x1080 and forcing one of them into 1920/1080 or anything than max makes them look like trash. I found the way around this was to plug one minor directly into my computer's (or GPU) HDMI cable and the other monitor into the A port of the device. This allows them to operate at optional resolutions rather than plugging them both into A & B ports of the device.This is pricy but I can confirm it's great and does exactly what you need it to do that other brands often struggle with. I'm super happy!I cannot confirm if you attach 3 monitors to this if it will work on higher resolutions or if you are using DPTV or other higher end transfer style cables.\",\n",

Once installed, it's just plug and it will detect the attached monitors.Thus, if you want an HDMI splitter that  is capable of extending with different displays, then this product if a must buy and considering it's way cheaper compared to others that are more than 100 bucks.\",\n",

Older computers require older versions of the software to run the displays, and that can be a pain - but doesn't have anything to do with this device, but newer computers, including M1 Macs, can use the new software and it works like a breeze. Plug it in, install the DisplayLink software, and you're off. I've had no issues with either an Intel based MacBook Pro without USB-C as well as the M1 MacBook Air with USB-C.

       "    'TL:DR Great docking station, dual HDMI works perfectly, but it should have included a USB-C port and/or more USB-A 3.0 ports.PROS:• Allows me to use 2 additional monitors with my laptop, for a total of 3 monitors• The only pass through extender I have used that will allow my portable monitor to function as an extended monitor• Relatively compact• More features than many other so-called docking stationsCONS:• No USB-C output• 2 of the 6 USB ports are type 3, the other 4 are type 2I am using an MS Surface Pro 7, with Windows 10. I have a typical Monitor attached to the laptop but, since the Surface Pro does not have an HDMI port, I have had to use a USB to HDMI adapter to connect it. I have used “Docking Stations” to achieve this, but they were actually just port extenders or pass-throughs. They were nice, small, and attached to the laptop, but they were not true docking stations. As an example, unlike the unit being reviewed, they did not have an input for microphone or headphones. Most did not have an ethernet connection, and they usually had only one or two USB ports. Considering that you give up a USB port on the laptop to connect it, that’s not much of a bargain.But the main issue was that I wanted to attach a portable monitor that I have (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4RMQBJ) but with any “docking station adapter that I used, it would only mirror the laptop display, not extend it. Further, I still needed another HDMI connection to use my other display and so I’d take up more space using a USB to HDMI extender for that. Whether I used the “docking station” or a single USB to HDMI adapter, and whether it was plugged into a USB # Type A or USB 3 type C, it would only mirror. With this unit, as you can see, I can run all three monitors at once and all are extended, not mirrored. Perfect!I have attached this docking station to my laptop using the Surface Pro’s Type and Type C USB ports and there seems to be little difference in speed when doing data transfers, but it’s still fast enough. The only thing that I see lagging is when I use the ports on the docking station to transfer photos from my phone. It’s not so much slower than going directly from my phone to my laptop that it makes a difference to me, I just noticed it.The two HDMI ports work great, with no lag at all. For that alone, and the ability to run two additional displays, one of which would not play nicely with any of my other adapters, makes this well worth the price.I do wish that they’d upgrade so that this gets at least one USB Type-C and make the rest TYPE A 3.0. At least with the Surface Pro, I can hook the docking station up to the Type A USB port and leave the Type-C open for other use.Other than the lack of a USB-C,  I highly recommended this.Review of: ICY BOX USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station',\n",
       "    'This dock is cool but has some issues, mostly with the HDMI ports.The dock can connect to your computer via USB-A 3.0 or USB-C 3.0. There\\'s an adapter that\\'s attached to the dock/computer cable allowing you to connect to either port. The dock has a second cable to plug into wall power. Before you hook it up to your PC you have to install the driver for your monitors. I think everything else on the dock works without drivers.I have been using my laptop with desktop accessories as a workstation because my desktop PC died. It\\'s been a real hassle to get it set up right due to limited laptop ports, and if I wanted to carry the laptop anywhere it would take 10 minutes plus to set everything back up when it was time to work at my desk again. This dock makes that way easier. It does connect to the laptop by a regular USB-A port to one of those old-school, full-size square USB-B ports, so if you want to use a longer one for some reason you\\'ll likely have to buy it. I would like to connect to the dock from my desk or from my bed, so I can watch videos and access my hard drive, but that means buying a longer cable.There are a bunch of USB 2.0 ports that make it way simpler to connect things like mice, keyboards, webcams, microphones, etc. It\\'s really nice. There are two USB 3.0 ports on the front so you can connect and disconnect easily. I\\'m able to run my USB 3.0 external drive through the dock which is really helpful, because when I carry it with my laptop it always seems to get bumped or dropped. But an external drive will stay powered up even when the PC is disconnected, unless you eject and disconnect it.The body of the dock is light but it comes with a heavy base that you can put on or leave off. If you leave it off, you can double-stick the dock to the back of your monitor, under your desk, etc.There are two large but not super-bright lights on the front, one blue and one green. Lots of lights are distracting or blinding but these don\\'t bother me at all.My main issue with the dock is that it has caused issues with my display, and it doesn\\'t support all the features of my PC and monitor by default. I\\'ve had to spend a lot of time researching problems it\\'s caused, downloading drivers and editing the registry. First the dock made my monitor and audio cut out every couple minutes, then it didn\\'t support all my monitor\\'s refresh rates and Windows color/advanced settings, then the night light wouldn\\'t turn on. I may have fixed the cutting out by downloading new drivers or adjusting the power settings or rebooting, and I fixed the nightlight issue by editing the DisplayLink registry. There\\'s a page on the DisplayLink website (the site where you download the driver for this dock). It\\'s called \"How to enable night light or f.lux on DisplayLink displays on Windows\" if you want to search for it. It would honestly be easier and more functional for me to just connect the monitor directly to my laptop which is too bad, because HDMI connectivity is one of the main selling points of the dock. I have an Anker USB-C hub that doesn\\'t require a driver and that supports all my monitor\\'s features without cutting out my video and audio. I\\'m not sure why it\\'s an issue with this dock, except that this dock works by USB-A *or* USB-C. Either way it\\'s a drag. I\\'m glad there\\'s a fix for the night light issue though.If you use monitor color adjustment like night light, you should only get this dock if you\\'re comfortable making a very simple, straightforward edit on the registry, or just not using the monitor ports. Otherwise the dock is very useful and takes up a minimal amount of space for how many ports it adds.',\n",
       "    \"I am updating my review and dropping a star, as I now have to connect an additional cable to get ethernet. All the peripherals still work just fine, but I have 3 cords running from my MacBook (power, ethernet, docking station). Original review follows [edits in brackets].This docking station works very well, as advertised [except for ethernet, which works, but at a third the speed I'm paying for].  You do need to download the driver before using, which takes 5 minutes or so. But then, it’s as simple as plugging in your various peripherals, and you’re off to the races.My MacBook Air doesn’t have enough ports to handle everything I want to add to my work environment in my home office. With the docking station, I connect them all with two cables (two, because this won’t charge my laptop, so power is still plugged in). I’m especially grateful for the ability to connect via ethernet instead of  competing for bandwidth with wireless devices. [But I have decided to bypass the device for ethernet after all, since I wasn't getting close to the speed I had hoped. It was reliable, but slow.]I haven’t noticed any lag created by the docking station. I’m getting full performance through my usb connection—to include gigabit ethernet [uh--strike that last remark about the ethernet].Other notes: • The boxing is attractive, giving the sense that they care about the product and their customer. • This is clearly an international device, as the power adapter comes with snap-on connectors for US and European standard plugs (a nice feature if you travel internationally, but otherwise, it just ensures it works where you live). • There is a glossy black finish on the front and one side—the top and other side are textured and matte. You can choose to feature one look or the other. • The indicator lights are bright. If it’s a distraction, you’ll have to put this behind your monitor or computer screen.\",\n",
       "    \"I got this for my simple setup - a Windows 10 laptop with a single monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I plug these into the dock which is powered separately. Plugging my laptop into the dock immediately connects everything and it works like a desktop computer. It is compact and looks neat and worked without effort.The description is pretty clear, and it is true, that this does not also charge the laptop. My laptop can charge with any of its 3 USC C ports and so I have to plug the charger in another port. So docking means plugging two things in, which isn't a big deal. However there are many docks where you can charge with just the one connection and I prefer that over this one.I'm not deducting a start because there are plenty of laptops, such as my Dell, that have a separate barrel connector for charging and would need this plugged in in any case. For these, this dock works great and is a neat and flexible solution. And again, it is clear that this is the case. But if you can charge via USB C, get a dock that also allows charging and connecting through one port.\",\n",
       "    \"Got this to enable docking station features on an older laptop that doesn't have USB-C.  Setup was simple with no drivers or installation required on an older Windows 10, HP laptop.  Plugged in several peripherals via USB and the monitor via HDMI to the docking station and they were all recognized at startup.  Really appreciate that this dock has 6 USB ports (2 are USB 3.0 and the others are USB 2.0), which is just enough for all the peripherals connected.  This dock has a removable base so it can be stood up on end or placed flat.  It also comes with a swappable plug so you can use this out of the box in North America, UK, and the rest of Europe.  We only have this with a single monitor, but there are two HDMI ports and dual monitors are supported.  And do note that even if you use the USB-C adapter, this is essentially running off a USB 3.0 port, so do not expect USB-C speeds on peripherals.  But if you're like us and have an older laptop that needs a dock, this is a great choice for a solution!\",\n",
       "    \"I had not heard of this brand before, but it had the features I needed to setup my home office so I decided to give it a try.  I plugged in my monitors and connected the docking station to my personal laptop, mouse and keyboard and it just worked.  I did have to change the power settings on my laptop so it would stay on when I close the lid, but that was about it.  Next I swapped in my work laptop, changed the same power setting, and again, it worked!  Now I can swap my whole setup between my home and work laptop in minutes.  It makes working from home a lot easier.  I've been using it about 3 weeks, and in that time I did have one crash that may have been related to the DS, but I can't be sure.  In my experience at work, these docking stations do seem to cause a small increase in the number of crashes.  Overall this seems like a good production that just works.\",\n",
       "    \"I ordered this for my husband's computer space because it was a tangled mess of wires.  I like that it has an aesthetically sleek design that stays surprisingly stable for its small footprint. Being able to add additional displays from his spare tablet PC has been a lifesaver since his main device has been down. The USB 3.0 ports are right in the front making it easy to shuffle things in and out. Being able to free up so many wires from being connected directly to the tablet has made his desk and cable management much more orderly and the desk space looks much more tidy. It does come with a USB Type A to USB Type C adapter as well if needed.Overall a great docking station unit that connects via USB and I have no complaints about this device.

Most if not all of them have been cheaper than this one, and it shows.The build quality here is a step above.. it feels solid and well engineered in contrast to the rickety, slapdash way the others were made. For that alone, I like this one better. It just feels professional.As far as functionality, everything works for me on my MacBook without downloading any drivers. (It's possible I have already installed the driver in the past to test some other unit, but for me it was plug and play).I love the design with the removable foot: remove the foot and lay it on its side if you like.Anyway, of the 8 or so docking stations I've tried, this is the one I'd recommend, without a doubt.\",\n",

I had USB-C hub but it was consuming laptop’s battery and it wasn’t able to connect two LCDs at the same time from one input.I had to upgrade with something connectable to two LCDs and battery efficient as well. After doing little research under the budget i found this unit. This doc station is serving both purpose to me and graphics output quality is great too. I haven’t tested audio ports yet but i am sure they ll work just fine. I would highly recommend this unit to mid level IT people.',\n",
       "    \"I began a job working g from home in the last few months. I purchased this hub so I could add a couple screens to my Apple laptop, as well as use a regular keyboard and mouse. It has not disappointed! Using this I am able to have three different displays going at the same time (one on the laptop and two in separate monitors). I also like that this provides extra USB ports since Apple took them all off their machines. This hub connects to your computer through a USB port. I did have to purchase a converter for the Apple laptop since Apple no longer has any USB ports on their machines. My personal laptop runabout on Windows, and I like that I can easily switch this over if I am using that machine.I highly recommend for anyone who is working from home and needs a better set up than just a laptop. And for the price, you will get your money's worth in productivity!\",\n",
       "    \"I purchased this docking station to use with my laptop, a larger monitor, cordless mouse and cordless keyboard. Everything worked except for the larger monitor the docking station would not detect it. I reach out to the seller, they sent instructions via email it still would not work. I phoned Amazon for technical support they also could not get this to work. The young lady on the phone said I needed additional hardware. The instructions received in email and in the package never mentioned any hardware other than what was supplied with the device. All I can say is buyer be ware. I was never allowed to speak with the seller. After doing some searching on my own I found out how to close the laptop and use the external monitor as my main monitor. It is sad people who are being paid for technical support can't help.\",\n",
       "    \"I was having the hardest time finding a reasonable solution that didn't result in multiple cables and adapters for my dual monitor setup. Sadly I have a work PC and personal PC, both have 1 displayport and 1 VGA (work) - 1 HDMI (personal). An old Kensington docking station proved unreliable and though I found a workaround with a displayport to HDMI adapter, it was short and used between both PCs...a pain!But hope came in the form of Wavlink, my goodness even the setup was easier for this than my prior docking station was. One driver identified on Wavlink's website via the model number. Immediately after installing both monitors extended across one another.\",\n",
       "    'So I ordered this product for one main reason, which is it works with macs and is USB. I have a older MacBook Pro and a music studio setup with multiple computers. My Mac has a better set of software. I did my search and went with this one. When I got it there was a few issues, all I did was email the support and they got back with in 24 hours and were extremely helpful when it came to solving the problem. I was able to get my two monitors connected and working. I also had a old thunderbolt connection with another monitor connect. This dock is great solid build and work with both Mac and PC. It’s nice and compact that I can hide it away in my desk or under it with all my connections. It’s great and would recommend this to all my Mac and PC users if you want to dock your laptop.',\n",
       "    'I initially purchased a USB-C dock with the intent of setting up multiple displays off my laptop.  Unfortunately I soon learned what many other owners of older HP laptops have also discovered...that while our machines may have USB-C plugs, they DON\\'T necessarily have Thunderbolt capabilities (which is required to power a USB-C dock). After doing some additional research, I found this gadget. And as the picture shows, it works great. Left side monitor is connected via HDMI, right side via VGA. Had an old 2.1 speaker system lying around that I\\'m running thru the dock via aux cord. As an added \"bonus\", my convertible laptop itself is still fully functional, so adding the wireless peripherals gives me a cheap and clean triple monitor setup. No noticeable lag or other issues, this dock is awesome.',\n",
       "    \"A must have if you use dual monitors and usb gadgets. My laptop has only two usb ports and one HDMI port. Everything runs thru this little guy. My laptop only has power cord and one USB from the docking station. I use my laptop for work and sometimes need to take it with me. This makes it a lot easier because I only need to unplug usb to docking station and I am ready to go. Same when back just plug one cord and back working at home. Very convenient and easy to install (windows 10). I would recommend this product. I've tried other converters thru usb for dual monitors and it was not good experience.\",\n",
       "    'The unit functions as advertised. I really wanted a docking station, but as time went on and I realized how infrequently I used my personal laptop, the expense and lack of choice for DSs steered my choice towards this model. In retrospect a cable does as good a job connecting  to my larger monitor,  but I wanted to use my wireless keyboard and mouse too, and this device supports them. However, the software they tell you to download, \"Real Multiple Monitors\" is completely unnecessary, and installs itself as adware. Every time I start my laptop, I\\'d get a message \"you have one hour left! Subscribe now or all you bases belong us!\" (ok, that\\'s an exaggeration.) Anyway, I had to find and uninstall the thing. And it still works fine without it.',\n",
       "    \"I chose this docking station since it had really good ratings. But this docking station was terrible. Every time I disconnected it from one laptop to another, the monitor wouldn't register and when I tried to use my sound system with the station, no sound would come out. This was supposed to be easy to use. I downloaded the driver to my computer for installation but nothing seemed to make it work right. I was more frustrated with this station than I was OK with it. I had it for a little over a month and nothing about it got better. I am now on the hunt for a better docking station and am willing to pay a little bit more for reliability. I wouldn't settle for this one. It's not great for the price.\",\n",

The USB ports and the video work well.  You have to install drivers from wavlink and that was very easy.  I found that you have to let the device boot before turning on your computer.  If the notebook goes into standby I find it is better to power off the device and power it back on before coming out of standby.  All in all I like the device.',\n",
       "    \"Super easy to use and compact. Doesn't take up a lot of space and helps keep all my cords out of the way and organized. I love my surface laptop 2, but it has a very limited number of ports. This lets me plug in my corded mouse, keyboard, speakers, HDMI to a bigger monitor, and Ethernet with room to spare. It also let's me keep my laptop open and have my textbook there while I take notes. All I have to do now is unplug it to take my laptop to school, and plug it back in when I get home. Out has made life significantly easier.\",\n",

Monitor blacks out by itself a couples times a day and I have to unplug the docking station and plug it back in. Usually the monitor comes back on immediately, but blacks out again hours later. Sometimes I can't get the monitor to come on at all. I'm getting ready to return it - I'll find something different.\",\n",

So i have Laptop screen, and one DVI Monitor connected to the WAVlink.  My HDMI screen i had to connect to the Laptop port, because connecting that to the device seemed to drag it down and cause mouse delays for me.  Also have speakers, mouse/keyboard dongle and two charging cords connected to WAVlink.  ONLY issue for me is that it comes with a traditional USB cord connection to the laptop so I am only able to connect the WAVlink to a USB 2.0 port.  Will have to get a Micro to USB adapter, and then will hopefully be able run the HDMI monitor thru the WAVlink where the higher speed connection will improve responsiveness of mouse.

       "    \"I am sure this works well for anything other than a Surface.  The problem with the Surface is that it only has one USB port which is where this docking station needs to plug in forcing you to use the USD on the docking station for your keyboard and mouse.  I at first thought my keyboard and mouse were having issues changed the batteries and even purchased a new keyboard and mouse hoping that would fix the glitching (working then not working) issues, but that didn't help.  The problem after speaking to several peers who experienced the same problem with the keyboard and mouse after purchasing non Microsoft docking stations is that the mouse and keyboard need to be plugged directly into the Surface or they will be glitchy.  The only docking station that I can see that does not need to be plugged into the USB port on the Surface is the Microsoft docking station.  It would have been nice to know that this docking station is only semi-compatible with the Surface.  I wouldn't have wasted the money on this docking station if I had known that it was going to cause the keyboard and mouse  to be glitchy.  I also would NOT have wasted the time, or money, trying to replace my keyboard and mouse in hopes that it would solve the glitching.  Now I have wasted so much time trying to get this docking station to work that it is no longer returnable.  Totally sucks for me, but hopefully someone else with a Surface Pro will read this before they purchase, and save themselves some time and money.\",\n",
       "    'I needed something to use as a docking station for my laptop to keep my devices plugged in and minimize clutter at the desk. Product worked well and was easy to install.However, the power supply stopped working and there was no way to know or troubleshoot.Thankfully I was able to return the item, and when the power went out a second time out of the return window customer service was able to send me a replacement power supply.I would still recommend this product despite my problems with the power supply, hopefully they resolve it soon.Suggestions for improvements: have a power supply with an LED to verify that it is functioning. Have a restart button with a light to restart the device and to verify it has power. Include or modify the design so it is mountable and/or include a stand to vertically stand the docking station.',\n",

       "    \"I bought this dock hoping it would be the USB A equivalent to the nice USB-C based dock I use for a newer laptop. Unfortunately, the bandwidth and power management limitations seem to make it impossible to fully utilize the features all at once. HDMI output wasn't smooth and stable enough to be usable for me, so I leave it disconnected and connect the display directly to a mini-DP or HDMI output on the laptop instead. When plugging in the laptop, sometimes the ethernet doesn't power up. Sometimes connected usb drive doesn't power up. Sometimes neither work on the first try. It undermines a lot of the convenience of having a single connection to easily connect and disconnect all the peripherals, if I still have to fiddle around with power cycling, disconnecting and reconnecting, and multiple retries, to get everything back up and running when I come home. At least I know that when I upgrade to a newer machine with USB-C / Thunderbolt 3, and a dock to match, things will finally be close to the ideal single-plug experience we've been waiting for.\",\n",

Seuls les entrées USB fonctionnaient.Tout d'abord, la version USB coûte moins cher que la version DP.Ensuite, chose vraiment sympathique pour ceux qui n'ont pas de DP, vous pouvez mettre votre second écran en le branchant sur la prise USB de votre PC.Donc vérifiez bien si votre ordinateur possède la technologie DisplayPort avant d'acheter la version DisplayPort, sinon vous serez embêter car ça ne fonctionnera pas !Sachez que vous ne pourrez pas mettre un troisième écran en HDMI ! Je n'ai pas fait le teste d'ajouter un troisième écran en DVI, mais je pense que c'est possible vu la description sur le site amazon.Techniquement, il vous faudra tout de même un câble DVI, HDMI ou encore VGA, qui sera branché à la station, mais vous aurez besoin d'uniquement une prise USB 3.0 connecté à votre PC pour profiter de la station. Je trouve que c'est un bon compromis, car c'est vachement utile.Comme vous pouvez le voir, vous avez une entrée micro, et une autre pour le son. Ce qui est pratique dans ce modèle, c'est que comme les deux sorties sont séparée, il vous est possible de brancher un home ciné à la station pour la sortie audio, et de garder l'entrée micro libre.Pour le reste, vous aurez 5 entrée USB dont deux en 3.0. Une HDMI, une DVI et une ethernet.Notez qu'un pilote doit être téléchargé et installé pour étendre son écran. Autrement, vous n'y arriverez pas.
